submittal did not include the required phase i report or a correctly scored numerical ranking system nrs scoresheet as required by 310 cmr 40.0510. phase i rep ort the submittal includes partial copies of two reports, both of which are missing various appendices and laboratory analytical reports referenced in their table of contents. the first is entitled phase i environmental site assessment

conducted at this site as an immediate response action. in addition to these two reports, the submittal includes a table of selected groundwater analytical results not including the maximum concentrations detected at the site, and an environmental firstsearch report which summarizes selected state, federal, and other computer database information available for the vicinity of the site. there is no report included in the submittal that compiles or references the required information for a phase i report in support of the tier classification. in addition, when the various components of this submittal are reviewed, in total they do not meet all the requirements of a phase i report. specifically, the submittal does not provide information or provides incomplete information regarding the number of on site workers, the estimated residential population, and the location and distance to natural resources including wetlands, surface water, and protected open space in the vicinity of the site. in addition, the submittal does not provide components of the phase i report specifically required by 310 cmr 40.0483, such as a map of either groundwater flow direction or the potentiometric surface elevations for monitoring wells at the site, and a summary table which includes minimum and maximum concentrations detected for all contaminants at the site. numerical ranking system scoresheet based on the information provided in the tier classification submittal, the nrs was not completed in accordance with 310 cmr 40.1500. a correct nrs score for this site would classify the site as tier ic rather than tier ii. specifically, deficiencies in the nrs scoresheet include but are not limited to the following e the nrs scoresheet does not appear to be scored using the highest concentrations of contaminants detected at the site. e section ii. b. of the nrs scoresheet is not scored 150 points to account for the detection of z benzene in the shallow, private drinking water supply well abutting the site at 12 main street. f e section ii. d. of the nrs scoresheet is scored 0 points despite the detection of greater than 5 parts per million total volatile organic compounds in groundwater within 30 feet of the occupied commercialresidential structure at the site, where groundwater is at a depth of less than five feet below grade. also, in the november 2000 report, photoionization detector pid readings from soil borings contained 515 and 676 parts per million in the two source areas abutting the building on two sides from former gasoline and fuel oil underground storage tanks. the nrs form states that a sample collected from the crawlspace beneath the building showed less than one part per million in headspace readings and referenced an attached letter for documentation and support. this letter was not found to be included in the submittal. e section iii. d. of the nrs scoresheet scores 8 points for groundwater depths of 5.110 feet below grade. the reports included in the tier ii classification submittal state that groundwater was found at 3.5 feet below grade, therefore this section should be scored 12 e section v.a. failed to score 20 points for the presence of protected open space within 500 feet of the site, which appears on the bwsc priority resource map for this area and also in the environmental firstsearch report included in the tier ii classification submittal. e section vi of the nrs scoresheet subtracts 20 points from section iv.c. on the basis that the public water supply well serving the center school appears to be upgradient of the site. however, according to section 2.3 of the november 2000 report included in the tier ii classification submittal, groundwater flow direction could not be determined based on the available information. in fact, section 2.3 concludes that groundwater may be migrating in several possible directions, including toward the stream which is on the opposite side of the school from

from the gasoline ust area in 1989, although soils did exhibit pid readings up to 300 ppm and a flashpoint of 200 f. technical justification for these discrepancies was not provided in the phase i, phase i, or rao. sampling of former ust areas should be performed using uptodate methods to verify soil is not a continuing source of groundwater contamination. dispenser areas were not sampled with the exception of two 2 soil borings b1.and b6. pid screening of soil obtained from b6 at 10 ft. to 12 ft. below grade ranged from. 666 ppm to 1173 ppm. confirmatory soil sampling of former piping runs

adequately characterize risk to human health, safety, the environment and public welfare pursuant to .310 cmr 40.08331b and 40.08354h. . specific omissions relative to risk characterization include 3a concentrations of volatile petroleum hydrocarbons vph and vph target analytes detected in a single surface water sample were compared to method 1 risk characterization standards. a method 1 risk characterization is not appropriate unless contamination is limited to soil and groundwater media as per 310 cmr 40.0942 and 310 cmr 40.09711. discharge of groundwater to the wetland was not fully evaluated as groundwater in the wetland piezometer exceeded gw3 standards for vph. gw3 standards are intended to be protective for potential surface. water impacts. a single surface water sample does not provide a conservative exposure point concentration to account for seasonal differences. as per 310 cmr 40.0926. therefore, risk to human health potentially posed by surface water contamination in the wetland was not determined. receptors may include children, construction workers, and trespassers. risk to human health may be characterized with a limited method 3 risk characterization for exposure pathways associated with surface water and sediment if further evaluation and delineation confirms the likely migration of potentially significant concentrations to sediment and surface water as per 310. cmr 40.0942b. an ecological risk characterization was not conducted to determine the risk to the environment by sediment and surface water contamination pursuant to 310 cmr 40.09421b 1. soil samples were obtained from soil borings at or shove the water table interface. . however, soil boring samples exhibiting the highest volatile concentrations by pid screening in borings b6, b7, and b8 were not laboratory analyzed. therefore, the risk posed by potential contact with these soils may have been under quantified and not adequately determined as per 310 cmr 40.09042a. pid screening of a soil sample obtained from boring b2 detected 570 parts per million ppm total orgariic vapors tovs. laboratory analytical results from nonce013029 the b2 sample detected 2.05 ppm cs5cg

corrective action, and underground storage tank sites states that compounds that tend not to degrade readily in the subsurface e.g., mtbe and 1,4dioxane and that represent an actual or potential threat should be assessed when evaluating the appropriateness of mna remedies. the american society for testing and materials astm guidance, standard guide for remediation of groundwater by natural attenuation at petroleum release sites states if constituents are present which do not readily attenuate, such as methyltbuty ether mtbe, remediation by natural attenuation may not be a suitable remedial alternative or may need to be supplemented with other remedial technologies. response action performance standards raps requires consideration of depepa guidance and the use of standards generally accepted by the professional and trade communities per 310 cmr 40.0191. average mtbe concentrations in mw5 were 587 ppb between nonce013029 november 1990 and september 1998 average mtbe

for degradation byproducts of mtbe, such as formaldehyde, tertbutyl formate, tertbutyl alcohol tba, etc., is not proposed to further assess attenuation of mtbe at the site. contingency remedies and triggers are not presented if mna does not reduce contamination are not presented in accordance with the epa directive. epa and astm guidance do not recommend mna if potential receptors such as private wells may be impacted. sites where groundwater moves preferentially through discrete pathways such as bedrock fractures may preclude adequate monitoring to ensure that potential receptors will not be impacted. there are two 2 private wells at 1012 sibley street and 18 sibley street within 500 ft., and approximately six 6 other private wells reported to be located on sibley street. the rao

for the trichloroethene release area from columbus real estate, llc formerly cherokee columbus real estate, llc. the raop was prepared by mr. joseph p. vitale, lsp6746, of earth tech, inc. according to the raop, a permanent solution exists at the site based upon a condition of no significant risk to public health, safety, welfare or the environment as determined in a method 1 risk characterization. the class b1 raop does not address the issue of potential dense nonaqueous phase liquid dnapl as a continuing source at the site. a review of the available data in support of the raop, however, indicates a strong likelihood of the presence of dnapl chlorinated hydrocarbons at the site. massdep refers to epa guidance in evaluating whether there is a strong likelihood of dnapl ata disposal site, in accordance with the response action performance standard under 310 cmr 40,0191. in accordance with the september 1993 epa oswer final policy 540r93073 ryaluation of the likelihood of dnapl presence at npl sites, the presence of a continuing source of dnapl in the saturated zone appears likely at the disposal site. since actual dnapl is physically observed in only approximately 5 of reported sites, epa policy 540r93073 recommends first an examination of the facility type and release history in determining whether there is a strong likelihood of a dnapl release at any particular location. the former borden chemical plant used large volume above ground storage of chlorinated hydrocarbon liquid products including trichloroethylene tce and vinyl chloride for many years at the site. analytical soil and groundwater data obtained from the areas proximate to the former storage tank locations confirm releases of chlorinated hydrocarbons occurred at the site. based upon the available facility type and release history information, there is sufficient evidence of releases of chlorinated hydrocarbon dnapl at the site. after establishing the possibility of a dnapl release based upon history and facility type, epa policy 540r93073 states the presence of a dnapl source in the saturated zone may be confirmed via groundwater analysis based upon the known purephase solubility of tce 1,000,000 pgl. due to the acknowledged difficulty in locating dnapl within a release area, however, and the general rapid decrease in dissolved tce groundwater concentrations with distance from dnapl reported at sites with known dnapl, epa policy 540r93073 recommends use of dissolved tce concentrations equal or greater than 1.0 of tce purephase solubility or 10,000 gl as a general indicator of a possible dnapl within the saturated zone. according to the class b1 raop and previous submittals, the highest tce and other chlorinated hydrocarbon concentrations e.g. dichloroethene, vinyl chloride are present in deepfmr. borden chemical 511 lancaster street leominster, ma overburden wells adjacent to the former tce and vinyl chloride aboveground storage tanks asts. in some instances the reported concentrations of tce exceed the current upper concentration limit ucls of 50,000 pgl in groundwater. from 1996 to 2002, dissolved tce concentrations in deep overburden wells and adjacent shallow bedrock wells adjacent to the former ast areas mw5db mw17db consistently contained tce dissolved concentrations in excess of 10,000 gl with the highest concentrations historically in the deep overburden wells up to a maximum of 110,000 ugl and 83,200 pgl, respectively. based upon the groundwater analytical data and in accordance with epa policy 540r93073, there is a medium to high probability of dnapl at the site. additionally, spatial patterns of dissolvedphase chlorinated hydrocarbons are greater at depth within the overburden aquifer as would be expected with saturated zone dnapl. tce concentrations between shallow and deep overburden paired wells mw5mw5d and mw17mw17d demonstrate significant increases with depth of at least two orders of magnitude i.e. from 100 pgl to 10,000 ugl. the presence of significantly higher dissolved concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons at depth in the overburden aquifer is characteristic of dnapl sites. dissolved tce groundwater concentrations identified in bedrock wells mw5b 42 pgl and mw17b 21 ugl also indicate the likelihood of dnapl extending to the lowermost portions of the overburden and uppermost fractured bedrock beneath the likely former storage tank source areas. therefore, the nature, composition and physical characteristics of the hazardous material at the site has not been properly characterized to likely include dnapl, in violation of 310 cmr 40.09043a, for risk characterization purposes. in addition, failure to consider relevant epa oswer policy in evaluating site conditions is a class ii violation of the response action performance standard raps, per 310 cmr 40.01912a, and the rao performance standards, as described under 310 cmr 40. 10041. there is little evidence of attenuation for dissolved chlorinated hydrocarbon migration into the bedrock aquifer despite the reported upward groundwater flow from bedrock to overburden nor is there evidence of downwardly trending dissolved concentrations in bedrock monitoring wells. quarterly sampling results of groundwater obtained from mw5d during 2002 were used to develop an average tce groundwater exposure point concentration epc of 23,200 ugl, however, an examination of the results show concentrations increasing from 12,800 pgl to 35,500 gl between the last sampling events in august and november 2002. the november 2002 sampling result is also the second highest historic tce concentration detected in monitoring well mws5d since testing commenced in september 1996. similarly, quarterly groundwater sampling results for tce during 2002 from monitoring well mw17d reveal an average tce concentration of 72,686 pgl for 2002 with a maximum of 83,200 gl from may 2002. both the maximum and average 2002 tce concentrations for well mw17d represent an approximate twofold increase from the previously reported maximum value of 41 ,000 pgl from march 1997. additionally, the maximum and average tce concentrations for mw17d in 2002 exceed the current tce upper concentration limit of 50,000 ugl. finally, for monitoring well mw30d vinyl chloride concentrations also show to increase from 68.6 to 261 ugl between february and november 2002. fmr. borden chemical 511 lancaster street leominster, ma based upon a preponderance of the evidence presented in the rao and

approximate sixmonth intervals since submission of the class c rao. i a review of the available data in support of the rao and in subsequent submittals, however, generally does not support the theory of significant dnapl at the site as a separatephase, as presented in the class c rao and subsequent submittals. massdep refers to epa guidance in evaluating whether there is a strong likelihood of dnapl at a disposal site, in accordance with the response action performance standard under 310 cmr 40.0191. in accordance with the september 1993 epa final policy 540r93073 evaluation of the likelihood of dnapl presence at npl sites, the presence of a continuing source of dnapl in the saturated zone does not appear likely at the disposal site. the epa policy recommends first an examination of the facility type and release history in determining whether there is a strong likelihood of a dnapl release at any particular location. based upon the available release history information, massdep agrees there was at least initially a small quantity of dnapl released to shallow soils at the site via either a spill during underground tce pipeline removal or from undetected historic leaking from deteriorated or compromised portions of the pipeline. prior to the release notification, hidelleyster technical services, inc. prepared an environmental site assessment report dated september 14, 1993, which included the results of soil and groundwater testing at the then digital equipment corporation facility. a review of the hidelleyster report indicates low dissolved concentrations of tce 15 pgl and of cis1,2dichloroethene 1 gl, a common breakdown product of tce, were detected in an august 12, 1993 groundwater sample from a shallow overburden monitoring well well h13 installed in the approximate location of the former tce ast. there was no indication in the hidelleyster environmental site assessment report, however, documenting the discovery of a separatephase dnapl at the site nor were dissolved concentrations of tce or similar solvents identified in groundwater samples above laboratory reporting limits 5 ugl from the several other shallow overburden monitoring wells installed at the digital facility by hidelleyster. a release of approximately onehalf gallon of separatephase solvent tce reportedly occurred during removal of the underground piping associated with the former tce tank in november 1993. gza geoenvironmental obtained six soil samples from the former tcewestminster, notice of audit findings and tank pipeline on november 24 1993, and analyzed the samples for volatile organic compounds. concentrations of tce up to 1,600 mgkg were initially identified in shallow soils in the former pipeline location, indicating some amount of dnapl tce was released during removal of the pipeline. concentrations of chlorinated solvents, including tce up to 18 mgkg were later identified in soil samples generally to a depth of approximately 7 feet below grade centered around boring tb6 in an area where during removal the pipeline was 7 observed to have perforations. a second area of soil contamination with up to up to 7 mgkg tce was identified at the northern terminus of the former pipeline. concentrations of tce up to 1.8 mgkg were reported in a soil boring gz4 approximately 60 feet southeast of tb6 between 513 feet below grade, indicating soil concentrations of tce above 1 mgkg extended some distance beneath the main manufacturing building at the site. groundwater concentrations in shallow monitoring wells installed within the building east of h13 contained concentrations of tce up to 4,500 pgl during sampling in december 1993. the department was notified of the release of tce at the digital equipment corporation facility on february 10, 1994. a maximum dissolved concentration of 8,500 pgl of tce was detected in a groundwater sample from well tb6 during december 1994. the source dnapl solvent originally released at the site was reportedly mostly tce with minor impurity solvent components i.e. 1 pce, 1,1,1tca and so should generally be treated as predominantly a tce release. the facility history and release type at least initially suggested the possibility of dnapl at the site either as an unknown quantity released due to pipeline failure andor as a result of the reported spill during pipeline removal. the august 1993 hidelleyster groundwater data particularly from monitoring well h13, indicates a significant pipeline release of tce had not occurred prior to the pipeline removal in november 1993. due to the unknown quantity and timing of the tce released, a detailed examination of assessment data and contaminant trends since release notification is necessary to determine whether a dnapl likely exists as a separatephase in the saturated zone. massdep finds little evidence of a continuing dnapl in the saturated zone at the site using the epa data evaluation criteria. first, no direct measurements or identification of separatephase dnapl has ever been made at the site in either the saturated overburden or bedrock aquifers. residual dnapl within the unsaturated overburden of the initial release area is presumed from the initial release description, shallow soil sample results and elevated groundwater concentrations of dissolved tce obtained shortly after the release was discovered in 19931994, there is no current soil. data available, however, to demonstrate residual dnapl continues to be present within the soil pore spaces of the vadose zone of the original release area. decreasing dissolved groundwater contaminant trends since the release do, however, tend to demonstrate the lack of a residual dnapl continuing source in the vadose zone second, groundwater concentrations in the overburden and bedrock aquifers do not generally. support the presence of a dnapl source in the saturated zone based upon the known purephase solubility of tce 1,000,000 pgl. due to the acknowledged difficulty in locating dnapl within a release area and the general rapid decrease in dissolved tce groundwater concentrations with distance from dnapl reported at sites with known dnapl, epa policy 540r93073 recommends use of dissolved tce concentrations equal or greater thanwestminster, notice of audit findings and 1.0 of tce purephase solubility or 10,000 ugl as a general indicator of a possible dnapl within the saturated zone. for the site, the maximum dissolvedphase tce groundwater concentration prior to 2000 19,000 pgl, reported in a sample from one shallow overburden groundwater well well hgs located proximate to the original release area, was greater than 1.0 of tce purephase solubility. groundwater samples from other shallow overburden monitoring wells proximate to the original source area, however, exhibited dissolved tce concentrations less than 1.0. additionally, sampling data since 2000 indicates dissolved tce concentrations in shallow overburden within or proximate to the original release area, as evidenced by well hgs, have decreased generally two orders of magnitude and are currently at levels below 0.1 of tce purephase solubility. because well hgs should represent worstcase conditions within or proximate to the original release area and absent any data provided to the contrary, decreasing dissolved concentrations in samples from this well contradict the proposed conceptual site model of dnapl in either the saturated shallowoverburden or within residual pore spaces of the vadose zone. similarly, the maximum detected dissolved tce groundwater concentrations in wells within the bedrock aquifer have never exceeded 100 gl or 0.01 of tce purephase solubility. thus, bedrock groundwater data obtained from monitoring well hgd, located proximate to monitoring well hgs, does not generally support the conclusion of dnapl present in the bedrock aquifer at the site as theorized in the class c rao and subsequent submittals. additionally, only one bedrock monitoring well outside the source area well br4, located approximately 1,400 feet from the identified source area and monitoring well hgs, has been consistently sampled since 2000. data from other distal bedrock wells e.g. br3, br8 and br11 groundwater samples from which have previously contained dissolved tce or cosolvent concentrations in the past are not currently sampled. third, in accordance with epa guidance, spatial patterns of dissolvedphase tce concentrations are not higher at depth within the overburden aquifer as would be expected with saturated zone dnapl nor are bedrock concentrations 100 pgl sufficient to indicate dnapl within bedrock. on the contrary, an examination of the limited available shallowdeep well pairs data e.g. hgs, hgd demonstrates generally an order of magnitude decrease with depth in the overburden, contrary to the expected results in the presence of a dnapl at depth. for example, maximum concentrations in well hgs prior to 2000 were reported at 19,000 pgl but decreased to 570 pgl by september 2007. maximum concentrations in the deeper hgd paired well ranged from a maximum of 2,200 ugl prior to 2000 to 34 pgl in september 2007. fourth, as evidenced by the well pair hgshgd proximate to the original release source area, temporal groundwater concentrations in the original release source area are trending downward since the initial release notification, demonstrating a strong likelihood of no continuing dnapl source in the saturated zone of overburden. groundwater data from 2000 to the present do, however, indicate the dissolved tce plume has likely migrated from the original source area as the highest reported dissolved tce concentrations are now located within the shallow overburden saturated zone downgradient and east of the original release area. for example, groundwater samples from the well pair hcs2hcd2, located between 300 and 400 feet east of and downgradient of well pair hgshgd show an order of magnitude increase in dissolved tce concentration between 2000 and 2007. well data fromwestminster, notice of audit findings and hcs2hcd2 also evidence the absence of distal dnapl concentrations within the overburden saturated zone at depth and distance from the original source area. dissolved tce concentrations from samples obtained from the well pair decrease an order of magnitude with depth and have never exhibited concentrations greater than 1.0 of the purephase solubility of tce. for the foregoing reasons, massdep finds little to no evidence of continuing dnapl at the site in the saturated zone. failure to properly consider all relevant guidance in developing or modifying the conceptual site model for conducting response actions is a class ii violation of the response action performance standard of 310 cmr 40.0191. failure to document the nature and extent of contamination by adequately characterizing the presence of

ii remedial action plan and phase iv remedy implementation plan on june 28, 1999, prepared by jeffrey lawson, lsp3376, of the johnson company, inc. according to the rao, the conceptual site model is separatephase dense nonaqueous phase liquid dnapl consisting primarily of trichloroethylene tce present in overburden and bedrock aquifers in discrete locations across the site. based upon the theorized widespread distribution of dnapl in pore spaces and bedrock fractures, remediation of the dnapl is infeasible by current technology. the rao states a temporary solution exists at the site, and the selected remedial action alternative to maintain the temporary solution at the site is monitored natural attenuation mna. other remedial action alternatives are stated to be infeasible, would mobilize dnapl andor otherwise exacerbate site conditions, a fiveyear periodic evaluation of the temporary solution was received on june 28, 2004, reconfirming the dnapl conceptual site model of infeasibility to achieve a permanent solution. remedial monitoring reports are submitted to massdep at approximate sixmonth intervals since submission of the class c rao. based upon all of the data submitted to date, massdep concludes mna alone is inappropriate at the site and insufficient for a temporary solution. according to the june 25, 2004 periodic evaluation opinion for a temporary solution report, reductive dechlorination is not a significant mechanism of attenuation at the site. the current conceptual site model contained within the periodic evaluation opinion and subsequent remedial monitoring reports is that of contaminated groundwater migrating under the main manufacturing building prior to discharge into an underground storm water drain pipe. concentrations discharging to the storm drain are anticipated to increase as the groundwater plume migrates to the drain. the storm water drain eventually discharges to a surface water body further east of the site. the unmitigated discharge and intermedia transfer of contaminated groundwater to a storm drain pipe at increasing concentrations violates the requirements of 310 cmr 40.10501 and 40.10035 to control, eliminate or mitigate, to the extent feasible, sources of contamination, direct discharge and intermedia transfer of site contaminants. it is also a violation of the response action performance standard raps under 310 cmr 40.0191 to reduce the overall mass or volume of contaminants and to use feasible technologies which destroy, detoxify or treat the oil or hazardous materials. the mna program also contains no provision to prevent or mitigate to the extent feasible the intermedia transfer of tce dnapl from soil pore spaces, if still present, in the originalwestminster, notice of audit findings and release area to overburden and bedrock groundwater. though massdep finds in accordance with epa policy there is little evidence of dnapl in the saturated aquifers at the site, any uncontrolled dnapl residual in the vadose zone or otherwise would be a continuing source of groundwater contamination incompatible with mna alone. finally, the mna program fails to feasibly mitigate or control via operation of the installed subslab depressurization system ssds the migration of tce vapors into the manufacturing building in addition to the violation of 310 cmr 40.0191, 10501 and 40.10035, use of mna alone at a site without provision to implement source control measures, remediate contaminated soil in the original release area, prevent intermedia transfer of contaminants and prevent further migration of the groundwater plume is contrary to the key principles to be considered prior to selection of mna under the april 1999 final oswer directive use of monitored natural attenuation at superfund, rcra correction action, and underground storage tank sites oswer directive number 9200.417p. the oswer directive is cited in the january 24, 2002 massdep policy wsc02500 monitored natural attenuation as consistent with the response action performance standard under 310 cmr 40.0191. in cases where intermedia transfer is unavoidable, the oswer directive recommends processes favoring degradation of contaminants over nondegrading processes such as dilution or dispersion. massdeps definition of mna at 310 cmr 40.000612 also identifies degradation as the primary mechanism to reduce the mass, toxicity, mobility, volume or concentration of contaminants. according to the information submitted, significant reductive dechlorination of tce is not occurring at the site under the current mna program, and the principal mechanism is dispersion and dilution via migration of the overburden groundwater plume at increasing discharge concentrations into the storm water drain at thesite. similarly, failure to operate the ssds results not in destruction or detoxification of tce and other solvent vapors, rather, the mna program permits intermedia transfer via dispersion into indoor air. remedial actions which do not feasibly reduce the overall mass and volume of oil and hazardous materials but rely upon dilution of contaminated media with uncontaminated media violate the raps under 310 cmr 40.0191. with respect to the bedrock aquifer, there are or were formerly private supply wells located on overlook road, north common road and also reportedly to the south in the center of westminster. sampling of the private supply well located at 54 overlook road only on several occasions had revealed detectable concentrations of tce and it is not stated whether this well is still in use or has been properly abandoned to eliminate human exposure. under the mna program, only one bedrock monitoring well pair br4sbr4d is used under the mna program to monitor bedrock groundwater, though this well has not historically been impacted by tce. the mna program includes no provision, however, to monitor bedrock wells historically contaminated by tce, cosolvents or degradation products, including wells br3, br8 and br11. the mna program also makes no provision to investigate further proven hydrogeologic connections between some of the affected bedrock monitoring wells, other bedrock monitoring wells at the site and private bedrock supply wells with historic tce detections or known or potential hydrogeologic connection with the site e.g. 54 overlook road.westminster, notice of audit findings and 0 finally, no private bedrock supply well sampling is performed under the mna program contrary to the oswer directive to adequately safeguard through monitoring human exposure potential. the failure to continually sample private wells, including investigating the possibility of impact to wells not previously sampled south of the site in the center of westminster and where necessary to eliminate, to the extent feasible, human exposure to site contaminants is.a violation of the requirement to continue to demonstrate elimination of all. substantial hazards under 310 cmr 40.0956 and 40.10501. the mna program also fails to reasonably satisfy the necessary level of diligence to obtain the quantity and quality of information adequate to

monitoring points vmp1 and vmp4 and one indoor air sample collected from the backroom on february 14, 2014. the samples were analyzed for air phase hydrocarbon aph target analytes and vocs. neither the subslab soil gas samples nor the indoor air sample were analyzed for aph fractions, which are constituents of concern coc for the historic release of cutting oils and chlorinated solvents. these indoor air data were presented in a table comparing the data to massdeps commercialindustrial ci threshold values tvs for subslab soil gas and indoor air. concentrations of cis1,2dichloroethylene dce, tetrachloroethylene pce and trichloroethylene tce were detected in the subslab soil gas at concentrations above applicable massdep subslab soil gas tvs. only acetone was detected above massdep tvs in the indoor air sample collected on february 14, 2014, and acetone is used in the sheet metal fabrication activities currently occurring onsite. the site building covers a large footprint on the first floor plus a newly renovated office space on the second floor, warranting more than a single indoor air sample. . furthermore, the failure to assess indoor for relevant coc and failure to collect an adequately representative number of indoor air samples are violations of 310 cmr 40.10041 a. during the level 2 remedial program inspection audit conducted at the site on december 17, 2014, massdep collected three indoor air samples in 6liter summa canisters fitted with 24hour regulator valves. prior to collecting the indoor air samples, massdep completed an indoor air quality building survey with mr. jeffrey cunningham of lemoine enterprises, llc, the current property owner. the summa canisters were placed in the backroom in a location selected to replicate the february 14, 2014 indoor air samples, the engineering area on the first floor, and the second floor office area. the samples were submitted for laboratory analysis for aph and vocs via method to15 sim. the laboratory analytical results from the december 2014 indoor air sampling event detected concentrations of acetone, tce, and aph fraction, c9c12 aliphatics in indoor air at all three locations above massdep ci tvs. concentrations of aph c5c8 aliphatics were also detected in the backroom above the ci tvs. the indoor air laboratory analytical data were provided to you andor your lsp by massdep electronically on january 6, 2015, at which time massdep requested that an imminent hazard 1h evaluation be performed. the ih evaluation was prepared by thomas williamson, lsp, on behalf of lemoine enterprises, llc, and was received by massdep on january 23, 2015. the ih evaluation concluded that a condition of ih was not present under current conditions. under current conditions and staffing all men working on the first floor fulltime and only onewoman working on the second floor only 8 hours per week, a condition of ih is not present. however, due to the hazard index hi of 8 on the first floor and the hi of 2 on the second floor, both of which are greater than a hi of 1, a substantial hazard currently exists and a temporary solution is no longer applicable, as per 310 cmr 40.10501a. additional comprehensive response actions under phase iv and phase v are necessary to mitigate concentrations of coc in indoor air. furthermore, in the future if female staff members are hired to work on the first floor, or if females work in the second floor office more than 1 dayweek, an imminent hazard condition could exist without mitigation. the site was classified as a location to be investigated ltbi in 1987 due to oil contaminated soil and groundwater. on april 6, 1993, massdep was notified that a hole was discovered in the bottom of an oil recycling unit located inside the site building. the recovery of napl from onsite monitoring wells has been ongoing at the site for almost three decades. mitigation of napl by use of a preventative boom installed in a manhole located in the culverted section of rigby brook which passes beneath the building has been ongoing since at least 2006. however, historical reports state that napl detected in the manhole are attributed to local conditions. according to the omm plan, maintenance of this boom is a required response action in order to maintain the temporary solution. given the preponderance of evidence with the presence of napl located beneath the site building over a period of multiple decades, and the lack of evidence of an upgradient source napl causing said local conditions, massdep refutes the claim that the manhole napl is attributable to upgradient local conditions and is unrelated to the disposal site. to that extent, the matter of how napl is migrating into the culverted stream beneath the site has not yet been resolved and further assssment is warranted in order to properly mitigate this migration pathway. the postclass c1 rao status report received by massdep on august 13, 2014, included laboratory analytical data for surface water samples collected from upstream bbd and downstream locations bad in rigby brook on january 14,2014. the downstream sample, identified as bad, detected concentrations of 3.34 micrograms per liter ugl of dce and 1.50 ugl of tce in surface water, while the upstream sample bbd did not contain concentrations of dce and tce above the 1.0 pgl laboratory detections limits. prior to the january 2014 surface water sampling event, surface water samples had not been collected since february 2007. such limited sampling frequency represents inadequate characterization on which to support a condition no substantial hazard. the january 2014 surface water sampling data further support that the site is the source of napl, dce, and tce discharging into and detected within rigby brook, which indicates that a condition of no substantial hazard does not exist, and it has not been demonstrated that the source of contamination at the site is effectively being controlled to the extent feasible with the ongoing response action approach of passive containment and monitoring, in violation of 310 cmr 40.10501a,b,c, and

the ros opinion states that the detected concentrations of methyl tertbutyl ether mtbe and cocy2 aliphatic hydrocarbons, detected in indoor air are below massdep background concentrations, therefore, they are not contaminants of concern requiring evaluation as a complete exposure pathway. , background concentrations are those that would exist in the absence of a release. massdep guidance

concentration trends indicates other compelling evidence for siterelated contamination exists e.g., such as welldefined concentration gradient andor the discovery of a similar suite of chemicals in . indoor air and groundwatersoil gas ors recommends that the chemicals involved in such a trend be included as cocs and evaluated. the substantial hazard evaluation, in support of ros, must document that site contaminants are not contributing to levels present in indoor air or to determine the incremental health risk posed by the release. massdep vpheph guidance recommends an iterative approach

oil or hazardous material be eliminated or controlled. several deep monitoring wells mcw13 and mcw14 were drilled in the warehouse building to investigate the source of 1,1,1trichloroethane and trichloroethene in downgradient monitoring well mw8. concentrations less than the applicable gw3 method 1 risk characterization standards of 20,000 parts per billion ppb 1,1,1trichloroethane and 5,000 ppb trichloroethene in groundwater were detected in mcw13 and mcw14. concentrations up to 19,000 ppb 1,1,1trichloroethane, approaching the gw3 method 1 standard, have been detected in monitoring well mw8, located approximately 60 feet and 120 feet hydrogeologically downgradient from monitoring wells mcw13 and mcw14, respectively. assessment conducted todate has not explained the presence of site contaminants in mws8 at concentrations tentimes higher than detected in the suspected source area. the gw3 method 1 risk characterization standards are intended to be protective of potential contaminant migration into surface water. the extent of vocs exceeding gw3 standards has not been defined. as a result, the source of vocs leaching into coachlace brook cannot be considered controlled as required to maintain ros. 2. the 1999 phase ii comprehensive site assessment csa, received by the department on december 30, 1999, presented results of groundwater and surface water sampling at the site. three rounds of samples collected from monitoring well mw8, located immediately adjacent to coachlace brook, between the dates of 1995 and 1999, contained detectable concentrations of 1,1dichloroethane, tetrachloroethene, trichloroethene and 1,1,1trichloroethane. the concentrations of 1,1,1trichloroethane in mw8 ranged from 15,000 pgl to19,000 pgl, which is below but approaching the current gw3 groundwater standard protective of ecological receptors of 20,000 pgl. a sediment sample sed3 and surface water sample sw3 were collected from coachlace brook near mw8 in august 1999. sediment sample sed3 contained cis1,2dichloroethene at a concentration of 340 ugkg. surface water sample sw3 contained chloroethane 4.0 gl, cis1,2dichloroethene 18 gl, 1,1dichloroethene 20 ugl and 1,1,1trichloroethane 41 j1gl. in addition, surface water seepage samples were collected in 1996. sample sws1, collected near mw8 at the base of the slope was analyzed for vocs using an onsite mobile lab. results indicated an estimated 1,1,1trichloroethane concentration of 5,200 pgl. all analytes detected in surface water were below their respective ambient water quality criteria andor other surface water quality benchmarks applicable at the time to demonstrate a condition of no significant risk existed to the environment. however, the phase it csa risk characterization did not quantify risk to human health in consideration of surface water exposures to children or trespassers to demonstrate a condition of no significant risk or no substantial hazard. according to massdep records, assessment of surface water and sampling of mw8 has not been conducted since 1999 to ensure a condition of no substantial hazard is maintained for ros as per 310 cmr 40.08932e. ifa condition of no significant risk or no substantial hazard is not maintained for surface water exposures, the detection of site contaminants in surface water constituted a condition of substantial release migration as defined by 310 cmr 40.0413. pursuant to 310 cmr 40.04123, the srm condition required the implementation of sete teres eee een tceenen nenclinton , 20011359 notice of audit findings and immediate response actions ira. failure to monitor groundwater at mw8 and adjacent surface water is a failure to continually assess and evaluate for ira conditions as per 310 cmr 40.04117. 3. the ros response actions currently consist of monthly gauging and bailing of petroleum nonaqueous phase liquid napl and biannual sampling of two downgradient monitoring wells for extractable petroleum hydrocarbons eph and volatile organic compounds vocs. during the most recent sampling low levels of chlorinated hydrocarbons cis1,2dichloroethene, trichloroethene and 1,1,1trichloroethane were detected in monitoring well ew23. the 1999 phase ii comprehensive site assessment csa indicated that chlorinated hydrocarbons have historically been detected in groundwater from monitoring wells, located under the building and adjacent to coachlace brook. also, a 1996 analysis of napl collected from mw5 contained 1,1dichloroethane and 1,1,1trichloroethane at a concentration of 360 mgl and 2,200 mgl respectively. volatile organic compounds vocs are comingled with napl and could be volatilizing from the napl plume. two 2 eighthour indoor air samples were collected from the warehouse and pressroom portions of the site building in october 1999 as part of the phase ii assessment. laboratory analyses identified 1,1dichloroethane 5.18 j1gm, tetrachloroethene 5.97 gm and 1,1,1trichloroethane 45.4 gm. tetrachloroethene was present at concentrations below generic background levels of 11 gm. the phase ii csa report attributed the concentrations of 1,1dichloroethane and 1,1,1trichloroethane to contaminant vapor migration from the subsurface into the building and the report concluded that the concentrations did not pose significant risk to onsite workers. indoor air samples have not been collected since 1999. in order to establish and maintain remedy operation status, it must be demonstrated that a condition of no substantial hazard exists at the site. the potential substantial hazard posed by the presence of vocs in indoor air has not been adequately evaluated. the phase ii csa documented a contaminant migration pathway to indoor air that has not been evaluated since 1999. massdep has determined that additional sampling of indoor air is required to evaluate for substantial hazards for the following reasons a. the detection of tetrachloroethene at a concentration of 5.97 gm was below the generic indoor air background level of 111gm. however, an established migration pathway of vocs from groundwater or soil to indoor ait has been demonstrated. pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0006, background means those levels of oil and hazardous material that would exist in the absence of the disposal site, i.e. concentrations that are not a result of the release or attributed to contaminant migration. therefore the available information suggests that the presence of tetrachlorethene is likely due to the release at the site and not representative of background conditions. a concentration of tetrachloroethene below 11 gm could potentially result in a substantial hazard. b. the 1999 indoor air data may not be representative of conditions at the site. specifically, the data is 8 years old and conditions at the site may have changed during that time. also, the samples were not taken during worstcase sampling conditions i.e. winter months, and therefore they may not be adequatelyclinton , 20011359 notice of audit findings and conservative for developing exposure point concentrations for a substantial hazard evaluation. c. vinyl chloride was detected in one monitoring well mw3a at a concentration of 1.3 ugl, which is below the gw2 method 1 risk characterization standard of 2.0 pgl. additional monitoring wells located under the site building did not contain vinyl chloride but analytical detection limits were often reported above the gw2 standard. . vinyl chloride is highly volatile and a known human carcinogen. additional monitoring of potential vinyl chloride impacts to indoor air is necessary to determine a representative groundwater exposure point concentration to confirm no substantial hazard exists relative to potential vapor migration to indoor air. 2 prise renate as iit failure to meet the performance standard for remedy operation status is a class ii violation of 310 cmr 40.08932e. failure to continually assess and evaluate for

contamination and determine conservative exposure point concentrations epcs, in violation of 310 cmr 40.09042a and 3a, and 310 cmr 40.09263. reports submitted for the site state that a floor drain in the onsite building was connected to an oilwater separator ows located behind the building. the concrete block ows was decommissioned in 1992, with 15 cubic yards of petroleum contaminated soil excavated and disposed. postexcavation soil samples were not collected for laboratory analysis, although a soil stockpile sample collected for soil disposal characterization contained total petroleum hydrocarbons tph at a concentration of 9,390 milligrams per kilogram mgkg. the ows discharge location was not documented in reports. notes in the project file provide conflicting information regarding the discharge point. an august 19, 1992, phone log report states that zecco personnel observed the ows being connected to a 275gallon tank. a copy of a zecco field note, dated august 21, 1992, states that it looked like the ows leached into the leach field. assessment around the ows included soil boring sh1, which was drilled in the excavation area and soil borings sh10 and sh11 that were drilled east upgradient of the ows. no borings were drilled west downgradient or north towards cady brook. the department has concluded that additional assessment is required to evaluate the nature and extent bat the release from the ows for the following reasons a. the ows discharge location was not determined. if discharge to the subsurface or surface water occurred, the discharge location requires sampling to determine the extent of contamination. b. petroleum contaminated soil is present near the ows as documented in boring logs for drilling locations sh10 and sh11 that indicate oily soil samples were recovered at depths of 5 to 8 feet below grade. because residual oil contamination was detected upgradient of the release area, the area downgradient of the ows may also be impacted and therefore needs to be evaluated. c. cady brook is located approximately 10 to 15 feet north of the ows. petroleum hydrocarbons were detected in a sediment sample collected downstream of thecharlton, rtn 2 0001032 notice of audit findings and ows area. due to the proximity of cady brook, assessment of soil and sediment quality north of the ows, toward cady brook, is warranted. d. elevated concentrations of lead were detected in soil samples collected from the floor drainhydraulic lift area. because the floor drain discharged to the ows, potential lead contamination may also present in areas affected by the ows. lead analysis was not conducted in soil samples collected from borings sh1, sh10 or sh11. e. consideration should also be given to the detection of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs 1.1 mgkg in a soil sample from the hydraulic liftfloor drain area and whether pcbs are a contaminant of concern in the ows release area. additional sampling for pcbs was not performed to determine the extent of pcb contamination or develop a conservative exposure point concentration epc. f. the site was historically occupied by an auto repair facility that may have used degreasers and solvents and which potentially could have been discharged to the ows. sampling of soil and groundwater for chlorinated volatile organic . compounds cvocs was not performed to fully evaluate the nature of contamination at the site. g. soil surrounding the former hydraulic lifis and floor drain were excavated and disposed as part of phase iv work. four sidewall samples and one sample from the base of the excavation were submitted for laboratory analysis of extractable petroleum hydrocarbons eph and lead. lead concentrations ranged from 10.5 mgkg to 690 mgkg. during the july 21, 2005, site inspection kevin oreilly, lspofrecord for the site, stated that the lead was commingled with the hydraulic oilwaste oil release. the human health risk characterization used an exposure point concentration for lead that was based on an average of the five 5 postexcavation soil samples. although lead was considered commingled with the petroleum release, analysis of lead was confined to the hydraulic liftfloor drain excavation area, lead sampling was not expanded into other areas of known petroleum contamination, such as test pits 1, 2 and 3, and soil borings sh10, 11 and 12 to determine the extent of contamination or identify a conservative exposure point concentration epc for lead. failure to meet requirements of site information required for risk characterization is a class ii

characterization, in support of the rao, identified current and future exposure pathways at the site as ingestion and dermal absorption of contaminants in soil. ingestion of homegrown produce, which is typically evaluated for potential future residential use of a site, was not considered a complete exposure pathway for this site. the risk assessment concluded that there was no current exposure to homegrown produce because the site was currently vacant. future use of the property to cultivate produce was determined not to be an exposure pathway because impacted soils primarily lead were located at 4 feet or deeper, which was below the typical root zone for plants. massdep agrees that ingestion of homegrown produce is not applicable for current site use vacant commercial property. however, the homegrown produce exposure pathway is applicable for potential future residential use of the property. massdep considers soil located at depths of 015 feet as potentially accessible since future redevelopment of the property may relocate soils at depth, to the surface, where contaminated soils may be in the root zone of plants. lead in soil may be subject to plant uptake and subsequent ingestion. therefore this exposure pathway requires evaluation unless an activity and use limitation aul is applied to the property to prohibit future cultivation of produce. failure to properly

a2 response action outcome statement rao on august 11, 2011. the rao was prepared by mr. richard wozmak, lsp, of endpoint, llc. the rao includes a method 3 risk characterization to support the conclusion of no significant risk at the site. an examination of the rao and supporting risk characterization indicates some migration pathways and human health exposures were not included or properly evaluated, specifically petroleum hydrocarbons and chlorinated hydrocarbons in indoor air to current and future occupants. levels of the chlorinated hydrocarbons trichloroethylene tce and cis1,2dichloroethylene dce were identified in indoor air samples taken on from the building located at the site at levels greater than the proposed commercialindustrial threshold values tvs in the massdep draft vapor intrusion policy for consideration at that time. numerous other volatile organic compounds vocs were also identified in indoor air samples at levels below the commercialindustrial tvs. the levels of carbon tetrachloride, methylene chloride, tce and dce also exceed the residential tvs. the rao cites the thendraft december 2010 vapor intrusion policy and attributes the presence of the chlorinated hydrocarbons and presumably the other identified vocs in the indoor air samples to nonsiterelated sources based upon the lack of detection of said compounds in soil and groundwater samples from the site. this rationale as presented fails for several reasons. in accordance with the thendraft and current massdep vapor intrusion policy, a lines of evidence approach may not be used to dismiss the significance of actual indoor air concentrations in this instance based solely upon the provided groundwater and soil sample results. the absencewebster, notice of audit findings and of actual soil vapor sample data obtained from locations adjacent to and beneath the building obtained contemporaneously with the indoor air results is a significant omission for which the proposed soil data is an inadequate substitute. the policy recommends weight be given to groundwater data, soil vapor data and indoor air data to evaluate whether a human health exposure pathway to indoor air is possible or likely at a disposal site. this approach is consistent with the requirement to determine the extent of contamination in all media, as required by 310 cmr 40.09042. in this instance, the absence of tce and dce in groundwater sample data obtained from the site would be only one favorable line of evidence i.e. concentrations of contaminants 2x method 1 gw2 groundwater standards. in addition, a closer examination indicates the proposed groundwater data is not as favorable as stated because the reporting limits for tce, dce and other vocs obtained by noverarmstrong during february 2010 in samples from the two monitoring wells mw101 and mw102 closest to the existing building were diluted by the analytical testing laboratory to levels that in some cases e.g. tce and carbon tetrachloride exceed the gw2 standards. similarly, the sole proffered soil data for vocs is limited to three samples obtained by noverarmstrong during january 2010 which are also inconclusive in as much as the reporting limits in the two samples nearest the building mw101 and mw102 were raised via laboratory dilution to levels ten times the reportable concentrations. therefore, it may not be definitively concluded tce, dce and other vocs do not exist in soil or groundwater at the site nor that such contaminants are present at levels below method 1 gw2 standards. even viewing the provided groundwater data in a light most favorable to the conclusion presented in the rao, that nonidentification of tce and dce in groundwater necessitates the conclusion of nongroundwater sources at the site, such favorable groundwater data would be negated and outweighed by the actual indoor air data as greater weight must be given to a direct line of evidence of a human health exposure point, consistent with 310 cmr 40.0926. since tce and dce were detected at levels above the proposed tvs, a probable exposure pathway via inhalation exists as described under 310 cmr 40.0925. although the rao proposes the tce and dce are from nonsiterelated sources, no additional information is provided as to any attempt to substantiate the claim by actually locating such nonsiterelated sources within the building itself or examining the building and environs for preferential pathways, as required by 310 cmr 40.09042. such an evaluation would have also been consistent with the recommendations of the massdep policy to, as in the present case, evaluate potential indoor air sources andor preferential migration pathways following a possible positive conclusion after a lines of evidence evaluation. in order to properly evaluate the possibility of an exposure pathway to indoor air, due to the unreliability or hitmiss nature of soil sampling and general inaccessibility of potential soil contamination sources beneath the building, soil vapor samples adjacent to and, to the extent feasible, from beneath the foundation of the building should have been obtained to properly evaluate the migration pathway and develop an exposure point concentration consistent with 310 cmr 40.0426. based upon the problems discussed above with the available groundwater data, additional assessment of groundwater for vocs would also have been highly prudent. absent such an investigation and data, tce, dce and other vocs above the commercial and residential tvs in the indoor air samples should have been conservatively included as an exposure pathway in developing exposure point concentrationswebster, notice of audit findings and for the method 3 risk characterization supporting the rao, consistent with 310 cmr 40.0925, 40,0926, 40.0992 and 40.0993. similarly, concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons were identified in indoor air samples. petroleum hydrocarbons, unlike the othervocs previously mentioned, were identified in groundwater samples above the method 1 gw2 standards. the rao cites the thendraft vapor intrusion policy lines of evidence approach to dismiss the indoor air pathway for petroleum hydrocarbons from consideration in the risk characterization submitted with the rao. this rationale also fails for the following reasons. first, as with the chlorinated hydrocarbons and other vocs detected in indoor air and consistent with the thendraft and current vapor intrusion policy, in a lines of evidence evaluation groundwater, soil vapor and indoor air data should weigh favorably prior to the conclusion of no likely indoor air pathway. as previously noted, groundwater data for petroleum hydrocarbons alone weighs against a conclusion of no pathway. indoor air data also indicates the presence of petroleum hydrocarbons. no soil vapor data was obtained. in the present case, though groundwater concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons are generally favorable i.e. most compounds are 2x the gw2 method 1 standards and the indoor air concentrations are less than the respective tvs for current commercial site use, the levels of cc aromatics and naphthalene are at or exceed the residential tvs. no future residential use restrictions were placed on the property. massdep policy recommends the most weight be given to indoor air data as this represents a direct line of evidence of the actual human health exposure point, consistent with 310 cmr 40,0926. the lack of soil vapor sample data adjacent to and beneath the existing building makes it impossible to conservatively estimate site contribution to indoor air contamination and precludes the possibility of categorical elimination of the indoor air pathway from consideration in a tisk characterization. finally, with respect to petroleum hydrocarbons in indoor air, a contemporaneous exterior air sample was obtained to demonstrate similar air concentrations of cc aliphatics exist outside of the building. this additional line of evidence alone is inadequate, however, as a rationale for excluding petroleum hydrocarbons in indoor air from the risk characterization as it fails to account for other petroleum hydrocarbon fractions identified in the indoor air samples. in addition and similar to the case with chlorinated hydrocarbons, the most significant information in determining site contribution to indoor air contamination in the present case would be contemporaneous soil vapor sampling adjacent to and beneath the building foundation. such an approach is consistent with the requirement to conservatively include all human health exposure points and estimate exposure point concentrations in a method 3 risk characterization as described under 310 cmr 40.0925, 40.0926, 40.0992 and 40.0993. failure to include the indoor air exposure pathway, develop indoor air exposure point concentrations and thereby provide a conservative estimate of human health risk to current and future occupants of the site in the method 3 risk characterization is a class ii violation of 310 cmr 40.0992 and 40.0993. submission of a class a rao not supported by sufficient assessment and evaluation commensurate with the nature and extent of a release necessary to demonstrate no significant risk and a permanent solution is a class ii violation of the rao performance

inspection conducted in november 2005, a spray paint booth and numerous hazardous substances were observed 100 gallons of paints and stains, oxalic acid, paint thinner, waste paint, paint remover, spent thinners, waste oil, gear oil, transmission fluid, motor oil and antifreeze. waste paints, stains, and spent thinners generated since 2002 had not been disposed and the generator of the waste materials was not a registered resource conservation recovery act rcra generator. the information contained in the dps opinion does not contain any documentation, or reference, with regard to the management or disposal practices and procedures of the hazardous waste materials at the site therefore, management and disposal practices of the waste material remain unknown. e six floor drains were observed in the southern portion of the building during the november 2005 site inspection. the available information indicates that occupantsworkers in the building had unrestricted access to the floor drains. these floor drains were reported to discharge to the municipal sewerage system, via an oilwater separator that was later determined to be broken, resulting in a direct discharge from the oil water separator to the environment. in july 2006, massdep received a release abatement measure completion report ramc. the ramc documents remedial response actions conducted at the site for the removal of the oilwater separator under . the ramc stated that the former owneroperator disposed of contaminants down a drain and into the oilwater separator. a dye test was conducted to determine the discharge location of the sinks and toilets in the building the test showed that waste water was entering the oilwater separator but was not observed entering the municipal sewer piping system. a video survey conducted to evaluate the oilwater separator revealed that the discharge piping extended under the building where it was determined to be broken. in addition, it was reported that the piping entering and exiting the separator was not properly sealed, resulting in releases from the structure itself. the liquid and sludge removed from the oilwater separator structure during the ram activities exhibited visual and olfactory indications of solvents, antifreeze and waste oil. based on these observations, massdep has reason to believe that that oil andor hazardous materials were likely discharged beneath the building and in the vicinity of the oilwater separator however, appropriate sampling was not conducted to conclusively determine the presence or the absence of contamination in the soil or groundwater that is likely associated with the uic system. two monitoring wells en7 and en8 were installed to assess soil and groundwater conditions associated with the oilwater separator. concentrations of methylene chloride were identified above reportable concentrations rcs, and extractable petroleum hydrocarbons eph and methyltert butyl ether mtbe were detected below rcs in soil and groundwater. reportedly, the samples collected for methylene chloride analysis were taken from below the water table. the high concentration of methylene chloride present in a sample from en7 made it necessary for the laboratory to dilute the sample, resulting in an elevated reportable detection limit, which may have obscured the presence of additional compounds that may have been present in the sample but could not be accurately quantified at the resultant reportable detection limits. mtbe, tetrachloroethylene pce and tetrahydrofuran thf were detected in en8 albeit below rcs. the presence of these compounds in soil and groundwater indicate a release that likely originated from the oilwater separator. monitoring wells were installed to assess vertical migration of the methylene chloride, however it cannot be determined whether the groundwater from these wells is representative of the groundwater in the source area, the site plan is not to scale and based on the location of the deep wells, they appear to be sidegradient andor downgradient of the source area. t approximately 100 cubic yards of soil were excavated as part of the 2006 ram activities. confirmatory soil samples collected from the oilwater separator excavation show nondetectable from the photoionization detector pid readings for all the samples, including the location designated a5. however, the laboratory analysis indicates a high level of contamination based on the elevated detection limits. the report states that because of these results, the confirmatory laboratory analysis data for a5 is unusable and field observations, consisting of pid readings and olfactory indications, were used",2012,2-0016236,MILLIS,https://eeaonline.eea.state.ma.us/EEA/fileviewer/Rtn.aspx?rtn=2-0016236

disposal site historically, 421 main street and 441 main street were part of the same parcel owned and operated by snell manufacturing, which produced small arms, drills and auger bits. the two adjacent parcels were subdivided in approximately 1950. two underground concrete vaults were located on the 421 main street arland tool property, and supplied fuel to heat both the 421 and 441 main street buildings former cpc engineeringwheelabrator clean water. fuel supply lines ran beneath the paved driveway between the arland and wheelabrator buildings. both vaults were reportedly used to store fuel oil until the early 1970s. after the 441 main street property switched to propane heat, the second concrete vault was allegedly used to store cutting fluid for arland tool until the early 1990s. both vaults were reportedly cleaned out and closed in place in the early 1990s. during assessment activities in 1994 and 1995, petroleumrelated contamination, including light nonaqueous phase liquid lnapl was identified at the site and on the abutting 441 main street property. massdep assigned release tracking number rtn 210905 to the release at the arland property and rtn 210907 to the release at the westerlyabutting 441 main street property. the source of petroleum impacts is believed to be historic releases of fuel oil from reported breaks in the fuel oil supply lines located between the two buildings. chlorinated volatile organic compounds cvocs were also detected in soil and groundwater samples at the site. laboratory analyses of onsite lnapl has identified elevated concentrations of cvocs, therefore removal of lnapl was the chosen remedy to remediate cvocs. response actions have included automated, passive, and manual recovery of lnapl, as well as gauging and sampling of soil, groundwater, and soil vaporindoor air. a pilot study consisting of injecting remedial additives has also been conducted at the site. test pits that were excavated in the driveway between the two buildings in the late 1990s revealed high levels of cvocs in soil.in this area on the northern portion of the properties. thearland tool . notice of audit findings and 421 main street,

excavated below 2 feet in test pit tp4 and below approximately 4 feet in test pits tp1 and tp3. the excavations were reportedly backfilled once the test pits were completed, and the soil in this area was never remediated. the soil in the driveway may be acting as a continuing source of contamination. in addition, the nature and extent of cvoc contamination in soil on the northern portion of the site has not been adequately defined in violation of 310 cmr 40.9042c1 and 40.08354f. the majority of contaminants that were found to exceed their applicable mcp method 1 risk characterization gw1 and gw2 standards were located in the petroleum release area i.e. downgradient of former vaults. however, in 2002, the highest cvoc concentrations were detected in groundwater collected from monitoring well mw992, which is considered to be located on the 441 main street property, and is upgradient of the suspected lnapl source area. total cvocs were found to range from 5,544 ugl to 7,590 ugl in samples collected from mw992 split samples sent to two separate labs. groundwater samples from mw992 were not subsequently analyzed for cvocs. the nature and extent of cvoc contamination in soil and groundwater on the northern portion of the site has not been adequately defined in violation of per 310 cmr 40.9042c1 and 40.08354f. groundwater samples collected from monitoring well riz5, located on the southern portion of the arland tool property, near the quinebaug river, were found to contain concentrations of cvocs that exceeded applicable gw1 standards in 2002, 2003, and 2004. subsequent sampling of riz5 for vocs from 2005 through 2008 did not reveal exceedances of applicable standards. however, a potential condition of substantial release migration srm to the quinebaug river existed at the site in 20022004. samples of the surface water andor sediment were not collected to evaluate all potential migration pathways per 310 cmr 40.09042c. periodic sampling of groundwater from downgradient monitoring wells has not been conducted in violation of 310 cmr 40.0904. only one deep monitoring well riz6d, installed in april 2002 is present on the 7.7 acre property. riz6d was drilled to a depth of 32 feet below grade, down to refusal, but not into bedrock. cvocs such as tce have a density greater than water and therefore tend to sink in the aquifer if released as a pure liquid. riz 6d is logically placed downgradient of the release area based on the shallow groundwater flow direction. however, the deeper aquifer, including bedrock, may have a different groundwater flow direction than the shallow aquifer. the vertical or horizontal nature and extent of dissolved cvocs has not been adequately defined, in violation of 310 cmr 40.09042a. metals were detected in groundwater samples collected from mw9 in september 1995. chromium 0.277 mgl and lead 0.0389 mgl exceeded their respective reportable concentrations. a site plan from 1996 depicts hoppers for storage of metal shavings and drums of metal shavings stored on exterior portions of the property. based on the current and historic use of the facility as a small arms and metals manufacturer, the nature and extent of metals contamination at the site has not been adequately defined in violation of 310 cmr 40.09042a and 40.08354f.arland tool notice of audit findings and 421 main street, sturbridge, ma a

portion of the arland tool property. a site plan from 1996 depicts a curbside storage area for hazardous materials just outside of a portion of building with an earthen floor in the north eastern portion of the site. the extent of cvoc impacts to soil vapor and potentially to indoor air at the site have not been adequately defined in the northern portion of the site, in violation of 310 cmr

groundwater on both the arland tool property and the abutting 441 main street property as early as 1995. indoor air samples collected at the arland tool property in 2013 and 2014 identified cvocs in indoor air in the office area on the northern portion of the property. soil gas or indoor air samples were not collected at the former cpcwheelabrator property to evaluate for an imminent hazard condition. following a meeting that was held at massdeps offices on march 22, 2002, and as required in a subsequent notice of audit findings and march 27, 2002, arland tool was instructed to assess cvocs that are comingled on both properties. according to file records, an evaluation of vapor intrusion into indoor air at the 441 main street has not been performed. on may 5, 2018, massdep collected one indoor air sample in an office at the 441 main street property. cvocs were not detected above the commercial threshold values at that time. failure to continually assess and evaluate for

submitted by altra, inc. on behalf of the owners of 400 grove and 402 grove street properties, 402 grove street realty, llc and altab, inc., respectively. the temporary solution was prepared by philip mcbain, lsp5121 and is supported by a method 1 risk characterization, including an evaluation for imminent and substantial hazards. the temporary solution documents the absence of an imminent hazard or a substantial hazard at the site. mitigation of a potential imminent hazard to indoor air is maintained by operation of a subslab venting system in the 400 grove street building originally installed under release tracking number 20016586. achievement of a permanent solution is documented as feasible based upon the elimination and control of chlorinated sources by repeated subsurface application of chemical oxidants sodium persulfate and water solution on the driveway property and intervening disposal site under . according to the temporary solution, insituworcester, notice of audit findings and remedial program for the driveway is anticipated to reduce concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons in soil and groundwater at the 400 grove street property to levels posing no significant risk. at the time of submission of the temporary solution, contaminant indoor air concentrations within the breathing space of the 402 grove street building did not appear to require mitigation to demonstrate no significant risk under current commercial use of that location. the temporary solution also specifies the evaluation of petroleum contamination sources at the site associated with former petroleum service station use of both the 400 and 402 grove street properties. on july 14, 2010, a partial permanent solution formerly partial class a2 response action outcome was submitted by santander bank, n.a. formerly sovereign bank, n.a., for the access driveway property located between the 400 grove and 402 grove street properties. the partial permanent solution states no further use of chemical oxidants is required to demonstrate no significant risk for the access driveway site. elevated concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons, however, remain in groundwater at the 400 grove street property. lower but still significant concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons are also present in soil and groundwater at the 402 grove street property. achievement of a permanent solution for requires resumption of chemical oxidation or another suitable remedial action alternative to demonstrate no significant risk at the 400 grove and 402 grove street parcels. 402 grove street realty, llc and altab, inc. have failed to continue to apply chemical oxidants to eliminate or control an identified source of chlorinated compounds as required in the temporary solution to achieve a permanent solution. failure to continue the remedial alternative selected in the phase iii toward achieving a permanent solution is a violation of 310 cmr 40.10501e. the april 2010 temporary solution also is not supported by sufficient assessment and actions to identify and document mitigation, control and migration of all sources of chlorinated hydrocarbons. the purported source of chlorinated hydrocarbons at and near the driveway property bisecting the 400 and 402 grove street properties does not appear from sampling data collected to date to be the only source for chlorinated hydrocarbons at the site. elevated concentrations detected in soil and groundwater on the 402 grove street property are demonstrated to be upgradient of the driveway property and point to an independent source of contamination on that parcel. in addition, historically reported elevated groundwater concentrations of chlorinated compounds on the 400 grove street property adjacent to grove street e.g. well ow5 are also not downgradient of the driveway property, indicating another source of groundwater contamination on the 400 grove street property. some of the highest reported dissolved groundwater concentrations, in particular tetrachloroethylene, have been reported from well ow12, on the 400 grove street property. though this well is downgradient of similar contamination on the driveway property, the order of magnitude of the reported dissolved concentrations in this well point to either to a contiguous or a discrete source of contamination on the 400 grove street property which has in any event not been sufficiently reduced by remedial actions conducted primarily for the driveway property under . continued elevated concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons in soil and groundwater at the 400 grove street property, in the form of apparent discrete continuing sources of contamination, have necessitated the continued operation of a vapor mitigation system in the 400 grove street building. lastly, indoor air testing conducted during april 2012 by tata i i 1worcester, notice of audit findings and howard also indicates further evaluation and possible required mitigation of the indoor air migration pathway may also be necessary for the 402 grove street building. 402 grove street realty, llc and altab, inc. have failed to adequately assess and mitigate or control the sources and migration of chlorinated compounds into indoor air of the 400 and 402 grove street buildings in violation of the requirements to eliminate or control sources and control migration of plumes of dissolvedphase and vaporphase hazardous materials under 310 cmr 40.100356, 40.10041 and 40.10501bc. in addition, 402 grove street realty, llc and altab, inc.

april 3, 2013, in violation of 310 cmr 40.08981. the april 2010 temporary solution requires periodic indoor air monitoring of the breathing space at discrete points within the 400 grove street building. at the time of submission of the temporary solution, quarterly indoor air monitoring was performed for the 400 grove street building. since submission of the april 2010 temporary solution, monitoring of the indoor air breathing space within the 400 grove street building has only been conducted on one occasion during april 2012, contrary to prior practice and frequency specified in the

prepared by john spirito, lsp8403, of gza geoenvironmental, inc. the rao report includes a method 3 risk characterization, asserting the conclusion a permanent solution and condition of no significant risk exists on the western portion of the site while a temporary solution exists on the eastern portion of the site. the western portion of the site includes the valpey fisher corporation facility, the former sand filter source area for the subject trichloroethylene tce release to groundwater and the adjacent wetland areas to the east. the eastern portion of the site includes the areas to the east of the northbound lane of interstate 495 between the highway and lumber street. a program of monitored natural attenuation of site contaminants in groundwater on the eastern portion of the site is incorporated into the plan of definitive and enterprising steps of the class c2 rao. a review of the supporting information does not support a permanent solution, the conclusion of no significant risk and the class a2 rao for the western portion of the site. according to information submitted to date, there is significant evidence of the continued presence of dense nonaqueous phase liquid dnapl tce beneath the western portion of the site, which constitutes a source of contamination within the meaning of 310 cmr 40.1003s and absent elimination or demonstrated control precludes a permanent solution at the site under 310 cmr 40.10352. massdep bases this conclusion in part upon united states environmental protection agency epa guidance in evaluating whether there is a strong likelihood of dnapl at a disposal site, in accordance with the response action performance standard under 310 cmr 40.0191 and 40.09031. in accordance with the september 1993 epa final policy 540r93073 evaluation of the likelihood of dnapl presence at npl sites, the presence of a continuing source of dnapl in the saturated zone appears likely at the disposal site. a review of the available data submitted in support of the rao and in prior and subsequent submittals, indicates the tce release at the site resulted in maximum dissolved concentrations of approximately 300 parts per million ppm or mgl, signifying approximately 30 of the solubility of tce in water and well within the epa guidance for confirmed dnapl presence at a disposal site. following operation of the remedial system at the site between 1997 and 2003, in which over 300 gallons of tce were reportedly recovered using a groundwater recovery and treatment system, residual groundwater concentrations of tce in excess of 1 solubility or 10 ppm as evidenced by sample results from monitoring wells gza1, gza4 and gza20 reported during the 20068 timeframe continue to indicatehopkinton, notice of audit findings and the likely presence of dnapl near the source area. further, the identification of concentrations in excess of 10 ppm in samples from well gza1, located further south of the previously identified area of elevated tce groundwater concentrations and screened to a depth of 59 feet below grade, appears to indicate a mobile component to.residual dnapl at the site. additionally and in accordance with epa guidance, spatial patterns of dissolvedphase tce concentrations are characteristically higher at depth within the overburden aquifer as would be expected with saturated zone dnapl and as seen in the deeper screened overburden wells gza1, gza4 and gza20. . a review of all the available information indicates the class c2 rao and monitored natural attenuation program for the eastern portion of the site are not appropriate given the likely presence of dnapl, the existing monitoring well and limited data available. firstly, in accordance with 310 cmr 40.10035, monitored attenuation is not appropriate in situations where there is presumed intermedia transfer likely to result in increasing concentrations in soil groundwater or other media. the existence of likely residual and migrating dnapl at the site and the absence of any groundwater monitoring data from the existing monitoring well network on the western portion of the site since the 20089 time period leads to the conclusion of continued intermedia migration from separatephase tce to groundwater, contrary to the requirement of a stable or shrinking groundwater plume following source dnapl elimination. therefore, the requirement to identify and control or eliminate the source to the extent feasible for the class c2 rao has not been demonstrated, as required by 310 cmr 40.10501b. secondly, a review of the existing groundwater monitoring well network indicates there are no monitoring wells of sufficient depth south of gza1 to adequately define the southerly and easterly horizontal and vertical extent of likely dnapl at the site, in violation of the requirement to determine the extent of contamination under 310 cmr 40.09042a, further east and southeast of the general presumed dnapl area, both deep overburden p4 and p5 and bedrock observation wells exist e.g. p6. however, these wells have not been sampled for many years and not since the reconfirmed presence of likely dnapl downgradient of the source area and in the vicinity of well gza1 during the 20068 period. according to newly obtained information, new residential development southeast of the disposal site at 110, 112 and 114 lumber street has included the installation of private potable supply wells. no further information has been provided concerning the well depths, aquifer pump rates, sampling data or likelihood of impact from conditions emanating from the disposal site. a review of the available site data indicates deep overburden wells p4 and p5 have historically exhibited low concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons associated with the disposal site. wells p4 and ps are located furthest south and southeast from gza1 and closest to the aforementioned new residential supply wells. as previously noted, there are no bedrock observation wells south or southeast of gza1 and the currently known extent of likely dnapl at the site. submittal of a class a rao without a sufficient demonstration of the elimination and control of sources of oil and hazardous materials, without defining the extent ofhopkinton, , notice of audit findings and contamination and without demonstrating no significant risk for current and

mw13, immediately adjacent to the river, at 34,200 part per billion ppb, over 480 times the gw1 standard of 70 ppb. surface water and sediment samples collected from the river adjacent to the site in october 2000 did not contain detectable vph or target analytes, including mtbe. the phase iv states that site conditions will continue to be monitored, however massdep has no record of any further monitoring of private wells, surface water, or sediment. detection of any level of siterelated contamination in private drinking water supply wells, surface water, or sediment would constitute a condition of substantial release migration srm as defined at 310 cmr 40.0006, and would require oral notification to massdep and the performance of an ira pursuant to 310 cmr 40.03135 and 40.04122 and 3. in addition, the phase ii csa shows that concentrations of gasoline contamination in groundwater exceed the applicable gw2 method 1 risk characterization standard within 30 feet of the building at the site. the gw2 standards were developed to be protective of exposure through potential vapor migration into occupied buildings. based on the phase ii csa, no indoor air sampling, soil vapor survey, or other investigation was conducted to stateline auto recovery and towing, inc., tyngsborough determine if a potential migration pathway for indoor air impacts were present or to determine the extent of contamination as required by 310 cmr 40.0835e and f. rather, the phase ii merely notes the lack of noticeable gasoline odors in the repair garage. the absence of odors is not sufficient in itself to determine risk to human health, the presence of contamination in indoor air at concentrations that pose or could pose an imminent hazard to occupants would require oral notification to massdep and the performance of an ira pursuant to 310 cmr 40.03117 and 40.04121. failure to continually evaluate for conditions requiring an ira is a class ii violation. failure to meet phase ii report

2-0018431 - LANCASTER - NON 02-16-2012,['40.0183'],"on december 1, 2011, massdep received a downgradient property status opinion dps. the investigative and assessment actions conducted in preparation for this dps were not of sufficient scope and level of effort to elicit the information needed to demonstrate that onsite releases have not occurred, or that onsite releases have not comingled with contamination that derived from potential offsite sources, if any. the data provided in the dps submittal fails to conclusively identify contamination migrating onto the site from offsite sources, and it does not eliminate potential onsite releasessources. based on the historical useactivities at 67 main street, lancaster the site, additional information, including but not limited to soil and groundwater data, is needed to demonstrate that the release conditions are not the result of historical site useactivities that have caused, or contributed to, the current onsite release conditions. the dps opinion is not supported by the data and information presented in the report for the following reasons e the historical use of the site has included a coal, grain and hay storage company, a fuel oil company, an autobody shop and a hair salon. most of these past businesses would have used or stored petroleum andor hazardous materials. e reportedly, a drywell was utilized onsite and removed circa 1997, no further information is provided regarding the construction specifications, the origin of the waste stream, the drywell discharge area, or the details pertaining to the closure of the drywell. a soil boring, which had been advanced to a depth of 20 feet below ground surface and completed as a monitoring well b4mw2, was placed in the approximate area of the former dry. well, and a soil and a groundwater sample collected from this location contained polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons pahs, including dibenza,hanthracene, commonly associated with waste oil. whether an actual release occurred from this potential onsite source has not been fully evaluated. e a fuel oil underground storage tank ust was reported to have leaked on site. the ust was excavated about 15 years ago however no records of the removal are available. samples from the soil boringmonitoring well b2mw1 installed in the former ust area show contamination at concentrations less than reportable concentrations rcs however, an assessment of soil and groundwater downgradient of the leaking ust has not been conducted to demonstrate that the release did not migrate beyond the extent of the excavation. e soil samples were not collected for laboratory analysis from the ground surface down to approximately 5 feet except in one discrete area of surface soil staining, which was subsequently excavated under a limited removal action lra. there is no laboratory data to demonstrate soil conditions above the water table at any other area throughout the site. e only two upgradient monitoring wells were installed for this dps assessment. the upgradient wells were placed on private property and were not sampled to determine the groundwater conditions. they were used strictly to provide groundwater elevation data to demonstrate groundwater flow direction. upgradient groundwater information must be provided to demonstrate that the oil andor hazardous material have come to be located at the downgradient property as a result of migration from an upgradient source. e the dps opinion refers to two alleged contaminant source areas causing the soil and groundwater contamination at 67 main street, 1 cumberland farms property at 114 main street and, 2 fiskes automotive at 75 main street. several release tracking numbers rtns have been assigned to cumberland farms two releases that were assigned rtns were deemed less than reportable concentration releases, a third release was reported to have contaminated soil only, and the earliest rtn was closed out prior to the 1993 mcp transitioning process. fiskes automotive, the second alleged source, has not had a reported release although they do have a history of onsite usts, and the use and storage of petroleum products. the current status of all past and present usts at the fiske automotive property is not clearly defined in the dps opinion. e the contaminants reported in soil collected from b5mw3 vary significantly compared to b4mw2., the extractable petroleum hydrocarbon eph analysis shows eph and several other contaminants in b5mw3 exceeding reportable concentrations rc compared to the detection of only one eph carbon range group, c9c18, at a concentration less than rc in soil from b4mw2., it is difficult to compare the groundwater results from each of these locations due to the performance of different laboratory analysis on the samples, however, based on data that has been reported, the ratios of the c5c8 carbon range compounds are 5 times higher in mw3 compared to mw2. these observations suggest the potential for two different release sources.",2012,2-0018431,LANCASTER,https://eeaonline.eea.state.ma.us/EEA/fileviewer/Rtn.aspx?rtn=2-0018431

environmental site assessment and dated may, 2000. this report does not include any sampling or subsurface investigations as required by 310 cmr 40.0480, but consists of a records review and site

at the site, and an environmental firstsearch report which summarizes selected state, federal, and other computer database information available for the vicinity of the site. there is no report included in the submittal that compiles or references the required information for a phase i report in support of the tier classification. in addition, when the various components of this submittal are reviewed, in total they do not meet all the requirements of a phase i report. specifically, the submittal does not provide information or provides incomplete information regarding the number of on site workers, the estimated residential population, and the location and distance to natural resources including wetlands, surface water, and protected open space in the vicinity of the site. in addition, the submittal does not provide components of the phase i report specifically required by 310 cmr 40.0483, such as a map of either groundwater flow direction or the potentiometric surface elevations for monitoring wells at the site, and a summary table which includes minimum and maximum concentrations detected for all contaminants at the site. numerical ranking system scoresheet based on the information provided in the tier classification submittal, the nrs was not completed in accordance with 310 cmr 40.1500. a correct nrs score for this site would classify the site as tier ic

contaminants detected at the site. e section ii. b. of the nrs scoresheet is not scored 150 points to account for the detection of z benzene in the shallow, private drinking water supply well abutting the site at 12 main street. f e section ii. d. of the nrs scoresheet is scored 0 points despite the detection of greater than 5 parts per million total volatile organic compounds in groundwater within 30 feet of the occupied commercialresidential structure at the site, where groundwater is at a depth of less than five feet below grade. also, in the november 2000 report, photoionization detector pid readings from soil borings contained 515 and 676 parts per million in the two source areas abutting the building on two sides from former gasoline and fuel oil underground storage tanks. the nrs form states that a sample collected from the crawlspace beneath the building showed less than one part per million in headspace readings and referenced an attached letter for documentation and support. this letter was not found to be included in the submittal. e section iii. d. of the nrs scoresheet scores 8 points for groundwater depths of 5.110 feet below grade. the reports included in the tier ii

the center school appears to be upgradient of the site. however, according to section 2.3 of the november 2000 report included in the tier ii classification submittal, groundwater flow direction could

notification requirements of 310 cmr 40.0300 and no further response actions are required. on january 9, 1997, the department received a letter from jems formerly marane oil corporation stating that the lsp evaluation opinion should also apply to site number 20212, since these numbers, according to jems, were issued for the same gasoline release at the same property. pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0361, the applicable reportable concentrations for soil contamination are rcs1, due to the sites location in a zone ii and consequently in an area where rcgw1 applies to groundwater. the tph concentrations detected in soil exceed the rcs1 standard of 200 ppm. therefore the site was a location subject to the notification requirements of 310 cmr 40.0300. failure to employ raps the lsp evaluation opinion submitted in 1995 was based on an inadequate investigation which did not include the groundwater investigation necessary to support an opinion regarding the conditions at the site and the need for further action. subsequent to the lsp evaluation opinion, as a result of investigations at a downgradient property, it has become apparent that groundwater contamination at the site persists and does require further action. in december, 2001, a property downgradient of the site filed a downgradient property status opinion, stating that a release of gasoline from the site had impacted their property, including contamination of a private water supply well. as a result, jems installed monitoring wells at the site, collected groundwater samples, and confirmed that groundwater at the site remained contaminated in excess of reportable concentrations. jems orally notified the department on may 8, 2002 of a release to groundwater resulting in contamination above reportable concentrations
