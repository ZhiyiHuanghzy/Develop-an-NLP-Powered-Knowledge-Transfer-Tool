(chi) to respond to the release. at that time, the environmental protection agency (epa) was notified and sent a representative to the site. . at 455 p.m, massdep atrived on site and met with an epa representative, a lancaster board of health (boh) agent, employees of the lancaster department of public works (dpw), and respondent. massdep inspected the stream with the onsite representative of epa and the bofi agent. massdep, epa and respondent deployed additional booms and pads at several areas in the stream, preventing the migration of oil to the nashua river. the oil was stopped at a pond located an estimated six thousand three hundred (6,300) feet downstream of the power house. massdep interviewed james stewart to determine his time of knowledge of this oil release. mr. stewart informed massdep that he knew of the oil release inside the power house building during the morning of august 4, 2008 at about 700 a.m, when an employee of respondent reported to him that a gasket failed on a high pressure fueldiesel oil feed line on one of the diesel engines that generate electricty for the college . mr. stewart informed massdep that he responded to the release, removed approximately 55 to 80 gallons of fueldiesel oil from the floor inside the diesel engine room, stored the recovered oil inside drums, and repaired the leak. the oil release covered several floor drains that mr.stewart assumed were sealed with concrete. mr. stewart informed massdep that on the morning of august 4, 2008, he believed that all of the released oil was recovered during initial response actions, the oil was contained inside the building, and did not impact the environment. therefore, mr. stewart did not believe the oil release constituted a 2hour notification condition. at that time, massdep requested an inspection of the floor drains inside the power house building. mr. stewart directed massdep to two floor drains within the fueldiesel oil release area. massdep inspected these two drains, which did not appear to be sealed with concrete. one drain located near a diesel engine was plugged with absorbant pads and another drain was covered with a loose fitting rubber plug. mr. stewart informed massdep these floor drains were covered with oil when he responded to the release.in the matter of atlantic union college acopce093e023 page 3 of 10 fb. h. mr. stewart stated that his time of knowledge of the oil release impacting the environment (stream) was when the fd informed him that afternoon, after 230 p.m., at which time he informed massdep that he conducted his initial inspection of the floor drains and determined this was the likely source of the oil release to the stream. . massdep requested that mr. stewart provide an estimated time that the release occurred, and include an amount of fueldiesel oi released to the floor inside the power house building. information provided to massdep indicated the release occurred some time between 1100 p.m. and 700 a.m. on august 3 and 4, 2008. mr. stewart used readily available data from fueldiesel oil inventory records, collected daily at 800 a.m. from the on site underground storage tank (ust) to quickly provide massdep with an estimated fueldiesel oil release volume inside the building. this estimated release volume was three hundred fifty eight (358) gallons. mr. stewart informed massdep that he collected between 55 and 80 gallons of fueldiese oil from the floor inside the building during response activities that same morning, and further calculated that up to 300 gallons of unrecovered fueldiesel oil had entered the floor drain system impacting the stream. massdep explained to mr. stewart respondents responsibility to clean up this release under the massachusetts contingency plan (mcp) and issued a field notice of responsibility fnor). during a separate interview with mr. stewart, the onscene epa representative issued a notification of federal interest to james stewart of respondent. chi, the oil cleanup contractor for respondent, arrived at the site at 800 p.m. on august 4, 2008 and began oil cleanup activities in the stream. massdep and epa departed the site once chi was briefed on site conditions and massdep verbably approved immediate response action (ira) activities. on september 12, 2008, massdep issued a notice of responsibility (nor) and request for information (rfi) to respondent with a deadline of october 3, 2008 to respond. . on october 3, 2008, james stewart of respondent hand delivered a written response to the rfi to the massdep central regional office (cero) in worcester. the response to the rfi confirmed the previously stated facts obtained by massdep on august 4, 2008. information included within the rfi response indicated that on the morning of august 4, 2008, mr. stewart measured the ust on two occasions. this data was included in the fuel inventory records to confirm that approximately seven hundred seventy three (773) gallons of fueldiesel oil was pumped out of the ust and into the power house building during this release event. the fueldiesel oil inventory table indicated the normal fuel use for that time of year is approximately four hundred fifieen (415) gallons. the data indicates that mr. stewart collected onlyin the matter of atlantic union college acopce093e023 page 4 of 10 a portion (5580 gallons) of the total estimated (358 gallons) fueldiesel oil released inside the building. additional information in the response for rfi confirmed that the floor drain system was not inspected for oil impacts until after 230 p.m., when the fd notified mr. stewart of the oil release to the stream. m. on october 10, 2008, massdep received an ira plan and release notification form (rnf) from respondent. the ira plan was prepared by clean harbors environmental services, inc. the rnf, signed by james stewart, reported the volume of fueldiesel oil released to be three hundred fifty (350) gallons with a knowledge date and time of release on august 4, 2008 at 255 p.m. the ira plan included information that the release to the storm drain system and stream ceased when the floor drains were properly sealed, and twenty (20) cubic yards of impacted soil within the release area was removed as part of ira activities. the ira plan further stated that no fish kills or florafauna damage within the stream area were observed as a result of this oil release. additional ira activities included the installation of groundwater monitoring wells near the power house building, surface water sampling in the stream, and cleanoutinspection of the underground storm drain system. n. pursuant to 310 cmr 40,0311(4), notification to massdep is required within two (2) hours for a sudden, continuous or

deeds at book 18642, page 247, for the site.in the matter of 7381 ashland avenue realty trust acopce133a003 page 2 of 10 the aul identifies the entire site property as subject to the aul. b. on december 31, 1997, respondent purchased the site from charles t. skowron by virtue of a warranty deed, recorded with the worcester county registry of deeds at book 19406, page 198. the aul is not referenced in the warranty deed. c, on june 21, 2012, massdep personnel conducted an audit inspection at the site. during this inspection, massdep observed what appeared to be evidence of a recent excavation in the area of the southeastern corner of the building. in addition, there appeared to be a recently excavated trench leading to a padmounted transformer. d. just prior to the inspection, massdep spoke with marc dipietro, trustee for respondent ( trustee), by telephone on june 18, 2012. at that time, trustee stated that he was aware of the aul at the site. trustee stated that a new transformer was recently installed at the site, and he thought that massdep was notified of the work being conducted by national grid. trustee provided massdep with contact information for national grid, and asserted that the work was not conducted in the hot zone. e. on august 20, 1012, massdep issued separate requests for information (rfis) to respondent and national grid. the rfi response from national grid states that while the company did install a new transformer at the site, it did not conduct any excavation at the site. f, the response to the rfi submitted by respondent indicates that site tenant robert chalue (site tenant) had requested that the new transformer be installed by national grid. respondent approved the installation as site owner. g. the aul identifies activities and uses inconsistent with the aul opinion to include any excavations and other earth work without proper training for work at hazardous waste sites per osha 29 cfr 1910.020. h. trench excavation was performed on site property subject to the aul by ryan eldredge of eldredge building and remodeling during the spring of 2012. according to massdeps telephone conversation with mr. eldredge, he has not been trained for work at hazardous waste sites, as required by the aul, in violation of 310 cmr 40.1070(2). i. the aul notes requirements relative to permitted and inconsistent site activities and uses, and obligations and conditions to limit exposure to soil contamination. review of the accompanying aul opinion (exhibit c) of the aul, confirms respondents assertion that the contaminated portion of the site (i.e. the hot zone) is not located in the area of the transformer installation and trench excavation. however, the activities and uses inconsistent with the aul do not clearly state for purposes ofin the matter of 7381 ashland avenue realty trust acopce133a003 page 3 of 10 risk communication that osha requirements are limited to areas of the site where residual soil

training and a soil management plan is required, pursuant to 310 cmr 40.1074(2)(g). j. the aul identifies installation and use of water supply wells for drinkingirrigation purposes as an activity and use inconsistent with the aul opinion. however, a notice of activity and use limitation cannot be used to limit exposure to groundwater for drinking water purposes, pursuant to 310 cmr 40.1074(1)(d). k. activities and uses inconsistent with the aul include the presence of infantschildren onsite younger than age 15 is restricted to infrequent visits of duration of two hours or less. this requirement does not identify how infrequent such visits should be, and is not practicably enforceable to ensure that children under the age of 15 years are not at the site for longer than two hours at a time. the obligations and conditions set forth in the accompanying aul also contain a similar restriction of children younger than 15 years of age. therefore, the aul fails to provide a clear description of activities and uses inconsistent with the aul, in violation of 310 cmr 40.1074(2)(f) and (g). l. the restriction of children and infants at the site is not included in the aul opinion, and therefore the obligations and conditions of the aul do not match the aul opinion, as required by 310 cmr 40.1074(1)(b). m. the obligations and conditions of the aul include a requirement that existing monitoring wells be maintained on the property for testing. a well decommnissioningsite inspection report was submitted to massdep on october 19, 1998. the report describes procedures to close six onsite monitoring wells (mw1 through mw6) by the former owner. the aul and aul opinion should either be revised to clearly indicate where any remaining monitoring wells are located, or revised to eliminate this requirement as unnecessary for the maintenance of a condition of no significant risk, as required by 310 cmr 40.1074(2)(f). n. maintenance of the groundwater monitoring wells

owner. 5. the following facts and allegations have led massdep to issue this consent order a. the site was first listed as a disposal site in 1996 under release tracking number (rtn) 20011276 and , 20015861, 20016001, 20016232, 20016250, 20016528, 20016619 were subsequently issued and linked to the site due to additional notification conditions. initially, mcp response actions were conducted by the property owners, richard, mark, andor ellen saxl (the saxls). in august 2006, the saxls formed pin hill, llc (respondent), and since that time, respondent has conducted all mcp response actions and has expressly assumed responsibility for the site. b. the property, once a singlefamily residence rented to a tenant, is now unoccupied. chlorinated volatile organic compounds (cvoc) and fuel oil containing mtbe have been released at the site and have contaminated the bedrock aquifer. the property and surrounding residences are served by private drinking water wells. sampling by the saxls discovered that several wells contained contamination associated with the site. bottled water and treatment systems were provided to the affected residents. in 2002, the saxls filed a remedy operation status (ros) opinion for the site. c massdep audited the ros opinion beginning in august 2005. as described in the january 13, 2006 notice of audit findings and (non), one of massdeps findings was that, because the saxls relied solely on private drinking water well data for the evaluation of the site, there was inadequate data to support the conclusions necessary to obtain ros. by failing to meet the performance standard for ros, the saxls violated 310 cmr 40.0893(2). the non required that the saxls terminate the ros, and, among other things, submit a revised phase ii comprehensive site assessment (csa), phase iii remedial action plan (rap), and phase iv remedy implementation plan (rip) by january 12, 2007, documenting adequate site characterization and remedial alternative selection and design. d. on january 13, 2007, respondent submitted a revised phase if csa, phase iii rap and phase iv rip. massdep reviewed these submittals and determined that the submittals failed to comply with mcp performance standards for reasons described in paragraphs se, f, and g below. e. pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0833(1), in conducting the phase it csa respondent must, among other things, collect, develop and evaluate sufficient information to support conclusions regarding the source, nature, extent, and potential impacts of releases, and the need to conduct remedial actions at the disposal site. respondents phase ii csa report failed to adequately characterize site conditions or provide enough information toin the matter of pin hill llc acopce093e001 page 3 of 13. determine the most effective remedial options, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0833(1). specifically, massdep found the following deficiencies in the phase i report i. hydrogeological characteristics of the bedrock aquifer have not been assessed at the site, and zones of contamination within bedrock at the source area or in the former saxl private drinking water well have not been evaluated. in addition, offproperty contaminant migration from the site has been inadequately characterized as required in order to determine what is the most appropriate remedial action(s) for the site. as a result, hydrogeological data provided in the phase ii csa fails to comply with the requirements of 310 cmr 40.0835(4)(d). ii. the release source area is not adequately delineated. due to the lack of assessment in the source area, the possibility of an area of high concentrations of cvoc in bedrock acting as a continuing source cannot be eliminated as the cause of increased cvoc concentrations. failure to adequately assess the release area is a violation of 310 cmr 40.0835(4)(. f, pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0853, a phase iii rap must identify and evaluate remedial alternatives reasonably likely to achieve a condition of no significant risk. the phase iti rap must also describe and document the information, reasoning and results used to identify and evaluate remedial action alternatives in sufficient detail to support the selection of the proposed remedial action alternative. respondents phase iii rap and phase iv rip proposed a permanent solution consisting of hydraulic containment and monitored natural attenuation (mna) to treat contaminated groundwater at the site. this remedy was unsupported by the phase iii rap, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0853. specifically, massdep identified the following deficiencies in the phase iit rap . i. as described in paragraph 5e, respondent has not adequately delineated the release nor has respondent established that the source of the contamination has been eliminated or controlled. therefore, inadequate information is available to support the selection of mna as a likely permanent solution forthe site. ii. breakdown products of cvoc have not been detected in groundwater samples collected at the site. respondent has not conducted testing for other mna parameters such as ph, dissolved oxygen, chloride and redox potential. therefore, the selection of mna as a likely permanent solution for the release is not supported by available data. g. pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0872, a phase iv rip must ensure that the design of the remedial alternative is sufficiently developed to support the implementation of the remedial action, to ensure that it meets the response action performance standard described at 310 cmr 40.0191. the phase iv rip does not meet the applicable phasein the matter of pin hill llc acopce093e001 page 4 of 13 iv performance standards due to multiple failures of the proposed design. deficiencies identified in the phase iv rip include the following i. il. ili. iv. vi. carbon units on the point of entry treatment system at the property were sized specifically for use in treating potable drinking water. the phase iv rip proposes to remediate contaminated groundwater by converting the original private drinking water supply well to a groundwater recovery well, which will substantially increase the volume of water requiring treatment. the phase iv rip fails to demonstrate that existing carbon units are sized appropriately to treat the increased volume of groundwater. water samples collected from the sax well carbon units on april 26, 2006 indicated that both untreated and effluent water samples contained tetrachloroethene (pce) concentrations well above the reportable concentration of 5 micrograms per liter (ugl). the phase iv rip does not provide design features that prevent or limit accidental discharge of pce contaminated groundwater exceeding reportable concentrations as required by 310 cmr 40,0045(3)(a)(1). the phase iv rip proposed discharging treated groundwater to the subsurface at a location downgradient of the withdrawal point, and treatment system sampling is proposed for the first day of operation and monthly thereafter. pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0045(3)(a)(3), discharge from the treatment system must be monitored on the ist, 3rd, 6th day and weekly thereafter for the rest of the first month of operation, and at regular intervals of 30 days thereafter. the phase iv rip proposes the future discharge of treated groundwater into injection well iw1 after influent pce concentrations fall below 200 ugl. however, the phase iv rip fails to substantiate how the treatment system is designed to prevent or limit the discharge of dissolved pce.at concentrations exceeding reportable concentrations to avoid potential contamination of downgradient drinking water wells. as described in paragraph 5h, an imminent hazard has been reported at the site, associated with the intrusion of cvoc vapors into the residence. because the existing drinking water supply well is proposed to be used as a groundwater recovery well, pce contaminated groundwater will continue to be pulled toward the residential building, potentially resulting in increased indoor air impacts via the subslab utility chase or vapor migration from underlying groundwater. the phase iv rip fails to ensure that indoor air is not impacted during groundwater recovery operations at the site, as required by 310 cmr 40.0874(3)(b)9. the phase iv rip does not provide a contingency plan to resolve discharge limit exceedances, as required by 310 cmr 40.0874(3)(b)7.in the matter of pin hill llc acopce093e001 page 5 of 13 vii. mna was chosen in conjunction with hydraulic containment as a permanent solution at the site. the proposed mna monitoring does not meet guidance published by united states environmental protection agency (usepa), american society for testing and materials (astm), or massdep guidance, and is inadequate for evaluating the effectiveness of mna. in addition, the phase iv rip does not propose a contingency plan for alternative remedial actions should mna prove ineffective, as recommended by both usepa and astm guidance. h. on january 5, 2007, respondent notified massdep that during additional assessment required.by the non, air sampling revealed indoor concentrations of cvoc posing an imminent hazard (ih) to the tenant and two children then residing at the property. the ih was assigned . on january 5, 2007, massdep verbally approved respondents immediate response action (ira) plan, including a temporary ventilation system. sampling conducted the next day indicated that the temporary system was initially successful in reducing cvocs and alleviating the ih. after an inspection on january 10, 2007, however, massdep modified the ira approval and specified that, because the fragile temporary system (consisting of a blower and a length of plastic film tubing) would not withstand normal winter weather conditions, a more durable, permanent system must be installed as soon as possible. i, on march 6, 2007, respondent submitted an ira plan which stated that a permanent system had not been installed because the tenant would be vacating the residence on march 23, 2007. on march 15, 2007, massdep conducted an announced field inspection and met with respondents licensed site professional (lsp) and its tenant. during the inspection, massdep confirmed that the temporary system had not been upgraded as required in the ira approval. the lsp informed massdep that (1) respondent relied on the tenant to notify respondent of problems with the system rather than providing adequate monitoring itself (2) there had been multiple incidents when the system was damaged or nonoperational as documented by statements and photographs provided by the tenant (3) the tenant was not provided with full information regarding the ih and (4) the tenant had not been provided with or received notice from respondent regarding his allegedly vacating of the property on march 23, 2007. j. on march 23, 2007, massdep issued to respondent a written denial of the ira plan and a notice of response action and notice of intent to mobilize, stating massdeps intention to proceed with statefunded response actions unless respondent. installed a permanent and effective subslab ventilation system to address the ih condition, and an acceptable monitoring and maintanence plan. on april 6, 2007, respondent agreed to conduct the necessary ira actions and continuous indoor air sampling. on april 20, 2007, massdep confirmed that the upgraded ventilation system was operational with an automated telemetry system providing telephone notification to the lsp of system shutdown. ongoing indoor air sampling indicates only trace levels of cvoc, no longer posing an ih. in the matter of pin hill llc acopce093e001 page 6 of 13 k, pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0411(7), parties undertaking mcp response actions must continually assess and evaluate site conditions to determine if an ira is required. because respondent knew that the temporary system was inadequate and site conditions posed an ih, respondent was required to continuously monitor the temporary system, either by means a telemetry system or by frequent site inspections and periodic air sampling. respondents failure to perform these actions from the date of the installation of the temporary system through the date of installation of the permanent system is a violation of 310 cmr 40.0411(7). l. pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0420(2), parties conducting iras must do so in compliance with any response action requirements deemed necessary by massdep in its approval of ira plans. as documented in paragraphs 5i and j above, respondent refused to correct this situation until april 6, 2007, after the issuance of a notice of response actionnotice of intent to mobilize informing respondent of massdeps intention to conduct the work and pursue cost recovery. respondents failure to conduct the ira as specified by massdep is a violation of 310 cmr 40.0420(2). m. pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0428, 40.1401(1), and 40.1403(11), parties conducting an ira must inform the public, specifically including owners andor operators, and other persons who may experience significant health or safety impacts from the disposal site that is being addressed by the immediate response action, about the risks posed by the site and the status of response actions. as described in paragraph 51 above, the tenant received insufficient information about the ongoing ira response action, and the nature of the ih. respondents failure to provide the tenant with this information is a violation of 310 cmr 40.0428, 40.1401(1), and 40.1403(11). n. pusuant to 310 cmr 40.0022(2), no person shall make, or cause any person to make, any false, inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading statement in any document which that

of detection of gasoline constituents in either the onsite or offsite water supply wells and given the age of the gasoline release, we conclude that the site (sic)does not pose a short term risk to area water supplies. therefore, in our opinion, additional immediate response actionsare not warranted. the irac included the laboratory analytical reports for drinking water sampled in october 1998. the analytical reports document the detection of methyl tertiarybutylether (mtbe) in two of the private water supply wells located between 550 feet and 725 feet west of the property at 195 city depot

not the source of mtbe in private wells. however, a review of the file by massdep indicates that mtbe was released at the site, and that the source area remediation was incomplete. in 1995 a gasoline underground storage tank, and the associated piping and pump island were removed. laboratory analyses of postexcavation soil samples collected in 1995 detected concentrations of mtbe up to 153 parts per million (ppm), exceeding the applicable method 1 risk characterization standard of 0.3 ppm mtbe for soil in drinking water areas. furthermore, because depth to the bedrock surface is approximately eight (8) feet below grade in the ust area, migration of mtbe into the bedrock aquifer would have been likely (9 ae ha 14 the conclusion of the 2004 irac for was not based upon assessment of the bedrock aquifer such as bedrock monitoring well installation, bedrock surface mapping, fracture analysis, borehole survey, or pump tests to evaluate hydrogeologic connectivity to the surficial aquifer, private wells, or surface water potentially impacted by road runoff, as detailed in massdep guidance document standard reference for monitoring wells, wsc31091. furthermore, sampling of private wells from similar hydrogeologic settings were not obtained to provide statistical analyses to demonstrate a ubiquitous condition of mtbe impacts in areas not potentially effected by a

extent of mtbe contamination. consequently, private wells were not evaluated as exposure points in the risk characterization included in the phase ii report. failure to define the horizontal and

this consent order1. at all times pertinent herein, the district was performing response actions at the site and ducharme wheeler was the districts cleanup contractor. between december 2000 and february 2001, ducharme wheeler conducted assessment activities to characterize the area surrounding two former ust systems that were scheduled for removal and replacement. the analytical results identified a release of petroleum hydrocarbons requiring notification to the department within 120 days of obtaining knowledge of site conditions. in accordance with 310 cmr 40.0333(2), a release notification form (bwsc103) was submitted to the department on february 23, 2001. the department assigned release tracking number (rtn) 213710 to the release condition in a notice of responsibility (nor) dated march 27, 2001 issued to the district. on april 12, 2001, ducharme wheeler submitted a second release notification form for tph detected in groundwater samples above reportable concentrations (rcgw2). in addition, a release abatement measure (ram) plan, dated april 12, 2001, was submitted to the department to promptly commence the remediation of petroleumimpacted soils and groundwater that would be encountered during the removal and replacement of the existing ust systems. the objective of the ram plan was to remove petroleumimpacted soil located on the exterior of the school in the vicinity of the existing ust systems, during their removal, so that residual petroleum concentrations would be reduced to or below applicable method 1 risk characterization standards for soil categories s1gw2 and s1gw3. the ram plan discussed the temporary dewatering of the excavation area to facilitate the excavation of soil and to provide shortterm hydraulic capture and recovery of nonaqueous phase liquid (napl) and petroleumimpacted groundwater which was expected to be encountered in the vicinity of the existing ust systems, expressly referencing napl previously detected on the site. the plan was presumptively approved by the department on may 3, 2001. three ram status reports were submitted to the department by ducharme wheeler on august 31, 2001, march 1, 2002 and august 29, 2002 respectively. in accordance with the ram plan, approximately 600 cubic yards of petroleumimpacted soil were excavated and transported offsite under a ma dep billoflading for recycling. in addition, a total of 42,300 gallons of oily water was pumped from the ust excavation for treatment and discharge. approximately 400 gallons of residual napl and rinse water from the frac tank were removed. all the work was completed in accordance with applicable regulations while controlling exposures to sensitive receptors (i.e. student and employees of the school and the surrounding environment).5. during the ram, as part of follow up assessment activities for the release from the ust systems, ducharme wheeler installed additional monitoring wells and borings to identify the extent to which soil and groundwater had been impacted by the release from the ust. 6. on february 27, 2002, napl was measured at two of the new monitoring wells at a thickness greater than 0.05 feet. pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0313(1), a person that discovers a release to the environment indicated by the presence of a subsurface napl equal to or greater than inch is required to notify the department within 72 hours of obtaining knowledge. pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0317(16), releases are exempt from the notification requirements set forth in 310 cmr 40.0313 through 310 cmr 40.0315 at a disposal site where (a) a response action is being undertaken in compliance with the provisions of 310 cmr 40.0000 (b) a release notification was previously provided to the department for the property on which the release has been observed or documented and (c) such presence of oil andor hazardous material is consistent with the types, nature, and quantities of oil andor hazardous material for which that notification was provided to the department. when the redesigned waste site cleanup program started operating in 1993, questions were raised about specific implementation issues. to respond to these questions in a timely way, the departments bureau of waste site cleanup periodically published mcp as that contain brief policy statements in question and answer format. volume 1, number 1, of the november 1993 mcp oq a, included the following question and answer q. do new releasesknowledge of new releases at existing sites (including transition sites) require notification to the department a. provided that response actions are being undertaken in compliance with the mcp (either the 1988 or the current mcp), knowledge of a 120 day release condition (i.e. equal to or exceeding a listed reportable concentration) at an existing previously reported disposal site does not require notification to the department, unless the condition in question resulted from a release not previously addressed in past notificationscommunications with the department see 310 cmr 40.0317(16). for example, the discovery of additional plume areas of a previously reported petroleum release at a gasoline station would not required repeated notifications to the department every time a new monitoring well revealed groundwater concentrations in excess of a reportable concentration of btex compounds. however, the (new) discovery of cyanide or coal tar wastes at the site would require notification if a reportable concentration was met or exceeded. knowledge of a new 2 hour or 72 hour releasethreat of release condition always requires notification to the department, even at existing sites (including waiver sites). a key consideration here is the word new.for example, napl behavior within the subsurface is such that napl in a monitoring well can appear and disappear based upon fluctuations in the groundwater table. the appearance of napl in such an instance (and where the napl condition was previously reported) would not require a new notification. also, waiver recipients must notify dep upon knowledge of any material information or data which would be likely to make the site ineligible for a waiver see 310 cmr 40.0630(2)(1)(emphasis in original). this mcp q a reflects the departments current policy with respect to the release and threat of release notification obligations under 310 cmr 40.0317(16). 7. on january 8, 2003, the department issued a notice of enforcement conference to the district in which the department alleged that the district was in noncompliance with m.g.l. c. 21e and 310 cmr 40.0000, and setting a date to meet to negotiate a settlement of the violation. the department alleged that despite the fact that the ram reported the prior discovery of napl and the intent to remove napl as part of the ram, (i) the district did not inform the department of the presence of a subsurface nonaqueous phase liquid (napl) at the site having a measured thickness greater that 4 inch (i.e. a 72hour release condition), as required by 310 cmr 40.0313, (11) the district continued to conduct an ongoing release abatement measure at the site without department approval after napl having a measured thickness greater that 2 inch was identified, as required by 310 cmr 40.0441, and (ii) the district did not seek department approval to conduct an immediate response action to address the subsurface napl at the site, as required by 310 cmr 40.0412. 8. on january 21, 2003, the department convened an enforcement conference with representatives of the district and ducharme wheeler in attendance. 9. pursuant to dep enforcement policies on compliance incentives applicable to municipalities (enf. 97.003), the department has discretion to waive or suspend assessment of administrative penalties against municipal entities where certain criteria are met. consistent with those policies, the district and ducharme wheeler have demonstrated that they have a) proceeded to expeditiously conduct assessment and remediation activities in good faith efforts to comply with the massachusetts contingency plan b) have returned to compliance promptly c) have demonstrated no actual harm or threat to the public health d) have demonstrated good faith intention to maintain future compliance by implementing risk reduction methods on an expedited basis and e) have not enjoyed any economic benefit or avoided any expense or tier fees by any alleged noncompliance. in september, 2002, ducharme wheeler conducted a design pilot test for the purpose of construction ofa groundwater remediation system to address residual petroleum contaminationiv. in soil and groundwater and the district anticipates the prompt implementation of such a system. . the parties have agreed to enter into this consent order because they agree that it is in their own interests, and in the public interest, to proceed promptly with the actions called for herein rather than to expend additional time and resources litigating the allegations set forth above. . neither this consent order, nor the districts consent hereto, shall constitute or be construed as an

ust removal process as part of required ust closure assessment activities. the ust was removed from the site by lagasse, and soil conditions were assessed by williamson on this same day. on december 13, 2007, a representative of williamson, on behalf of respondent, called the massdep hotline to notify of a 72hour reporting condition at the site. specifically, on december 6, 2007, during the gasoline ust removal process, a representative of williamson utilized a photoionization detector (pid) to screen the headspace of soil samples within 10 feet of the ust and detected a soil headspace of 1,800 parts per million (ppm) by volume of total organic vapors as benzene in the soil sample. . following release notification to massdep, massdep emergency response personnel requested that

to notify within. two hours ofa release that could pose an imminent hazard. 311(7) d b of documents, 310 cmr 40. ob222). on january 13, 2003, massdep received a release notification form (rnf) from respondent notifying massdep of a 120day release condition at the site forfile no. acopce053a022 2 concentrations of pcbs in soils above the applicable reportable concentration (rcs1). information contained within the rnf also indicated that concentrations in excess of 10 parts per million (ppm) pcbs were identified in surficial soil samples collected on october 28, 1999, from a former transformer dismantling area of the site. according to the rnf, respondent obtained knowledge of the release of pcbs on november 13, 2002. concentrations of pcbs greater than or equal to 10 ppm in surficial soil at any location within 500 feet of a residential dwelling require notification as a potential imminent hazard within two hours of obtaining knowledge, per 310 cmr 40.0311(7), unless access to the site is controlled or prevented by means of bituminous pavement, concrete, fencing, or another physical barrier. during an inspection of the site conducted on march 18, 2003, department personnel observed that access to pcbcontaminated surficial soil located within 500 feet of a residence was not adequately controlled or restricted by an appropriate physical barrier, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0311(7). therefore, notification was required within two hours of obtaining knowledge on november 13, 2002, of the concentrations of pcbs detected at the site. respondent asserts that neither his licensed site professionals (lsps), nor any other person, informed him of the need to notify massdep of the release of pcbs when detected in 1999. the date of knowledge stated in the rnf as november 13, 2002, was inaccurate, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0022(2). b. failure to conduct an immediate response action, 310 cmr 40.0405(2) the notification provided to massdep on january 13, 2003, stated that an imminent hazard does not exist at the site because fencing restricts access. a diagram submitted with the notification depicted approximately 300 feet of the western boundary of the site between the area of reported pcb contamination and the nearest residential area as unfenced. on march 18, 2003, massdep conducted a site inspection that confirmed the absence of a chainlink fence around the property. the site, therefore, is considered accessible. respondent did not take action to eliminate the potential imminent hazard prior to notification or as an immediate response action, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0405(2). massdep agreed to the temporary use of snow fencing and warning signs to prevent access to the site until secure permanent fencing could be installed as an immediate response action. a sixfoot chain link fence and signage were installed to prevent access to the site in february 2004. c. failure to meet requirements of class b response action outcomes 310 cmr 2. 401046 violation of res onse action outcomes 3 10 cmr 40. 0020 massdep received a class b2 response action outcome (rao) statement and. supporting method 3 risk characterization on november 22,

soils for the entire 10acre site, based upon a calculated average of four surficial soil samples. on october 5, 1999, a letter report prepared by gza geoenvironmental, inc. was sent to respondent that contained laboratory results of pcb analyses for 12 surficial soil samples collected on august 19, 1999, ranging from 4.8 ppm to 31.4 ppm, with an average concentration of 16.4 ppm, exceeding the imminent hazard level of 10 ppm total pcbs. laboratory analytical results of 35 surficial soil samples obtained on october 28, 1999, and provided to respondent on november 13, 2002, detected concentrations of pcbs ranging from below detection limits to 168.6 ppm, exceeding the upper concentration limit of 100 ppm total pcbs with an average detected concentration of 11.66 ppm, exceeding the imminent hazard level of 10 ppm total pcbs. the detected concentrations of pcbs indicate a condition of no significant risk to human health and public welfare does not exist . at the site. therefore, the requirements for a class b2 rao have not been met, in violation of 310 cmr 40.1046(2)(a). the detection of pcbs exceeding the previously calculated epcs indicate a change in the exposure potential upon which the rao is based and additional response actions are needed to maintain or achieve a condition of no significant risk. massdep was not notified immediately that the conditions for the rao have not been met, as required by 310 cmr 40.0020(1)(a). d. failure to meet response action performance standards, 310 cmr 40.0191 massdep received a class b2 rao on november 22, 1996, stating a condition of no significant risk exists at the site with respect to soil contamination by pcbs. on january 13, 2003, massdep was notified of a release of pcbs in surficial soil. the new release notification provides laboratory analytical results revealing pcb concentrations in surficial soils above the upper concentration limits (ucls) that demonstrate categorically a condition of significant risk and a potential imminent hazard in the former transformer dismantling area. information submitted in response to a request for information (rfd dated july 30, 2003, indicates the location of the former transformer oil disposal area where transformer oil was historically drained from transformers directly to the ground surface. this information was readily obtainable from former and current employees of garbose metals company at the time of the 1996 rao submitted by gza.. drained transformer hulls were historically burned on another portion of the site identified as the transformer burn area. soil sampling for the rao to previously conclude a condition of no significant risk was limited to the collection of two surficial soil samples in the general location of the transformer dismantling area for pcb analysis. the phase i report and tier classification received by massdep on december 1, 2003, provides analytical data for sixtysix (66) surficial soil samples collected since the new notification that have detected total pcb concentrations upfile no. acopce053a022 4 to 107 ppm in the transformer dismantling area, transformer burn area, and other locations at the site property. the level of diligence employed to support the rao did not include sufficient sampling of surficial soil as would be reasonably necessary to obtain the quantity and quality of information to adequately determine potential risk associated with the release of transformer oil to the ground surface and evaluate remedial action alternatives, in violation of the

(2) immediate response actions shall be conducted in compliance with all applicable provisions and time lines specified in 310 cmr 40.0400, and in compliance with any response action requirements deemed necessary by the department andor specified by the department in its approval of immediate response action plans. 2. fact on march 6, 1997, the departmentwas notified of the presence of three inches of napl in a monitoring well at the site, and assigned release tracking 20011634 to this condition. the department orally approved an immediate response action (ira) to include weekly gauging and bailing of the napl. on april 3, 1997, the department received notification of an imminent hazard condition at the site, specifically, that polychlorinated biphenyls (pcbs) were present at up to 7,816 parts per million (ppm) in accessible surficial soil at the site. the department assigned release tracking 20011667 to this condition and approved an ira to include fencing the area and further assessment to delineate the extent of the imminent hazard conditions. an ira plan was submitted for both 2001 1634 and 20011667 on may 12, 1997, which restated that the prp intended to conduct these actions. an ira status report was submitted on july 14, 1997, the second status report was submitted late on march 12, 1998, and the subsequent six ira status reports required through 2001 were not submitted. on august 4, 1998, the department received a letter from the lsp of record, stating that he was no longer retained by the prp to conduct the required iras.acopce053a012 4 on may 1, 1999, the department conducted a site inspection and found that the fence had not been maintained and that the imminent hazard concentrations of pcb in soil were readily accessible. the department issued a notice of response action (nora) to the prp, requiring that he correct the violation or the department would take statefunded actions and seek cost recovery. the prp submitted a letter stating that he had retained a fencing company to repair the fence. the department issued a to the prp for violations, including failure to submit ira status reports, on april 27, 2001. asa result, the prp again retained a consultant and began submitting ira status reports on july 20, 2001. on february 20, 2002, the department conducted an audit inspection and observed 3.5 feet of napl in a monitoring well at the site. in subsequent ira status reports, the consultant acknowledged that napl had not been bailed between the stoppage of work in august 1998 and the audit inspection in 2002. on june 17, 2002, the department was notified of imminent hazard concentrations of pcb in surficial soil in a different area (the southern end) of the site. the department assigned release tracking 20014355 and approved a third ira, including the following requirements post signs and install chain link fencing around impacted area conduct imminent hazard evaluation of the area assess to determine the vertical and lateral extent and resample the areas in question. an ira plan was submitted on august 29, 2002. this submittal concludes that there is no imminent hazard at the southern end of the site because the contamination is fenced with temporary fencing, however it also states that the extent of the contamination has not been delineated. no imminent hazard evaluation pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0950 was conducted. the most recent ira status report for all three ira conditions was received on january 10, 2003. that report continues to state that due to access problems the prp has not delineated the imminent hazard conditions to the south. no documentation has been provided to the department to demonstrate that the prp has made efforts to gain access from the owner of the abutting property. the department contacted the prps consultant in november 2003. according to the consultant, they did not have any contract to conduct additional work at the site and had conducted no ira work since at least july 2003. the department visited the site on december 9, 2003, and found that the temporary fencing was damaged and did not restrict access to the pcb contaminated soil at either the north or south end of the site.acopce053a012 5 3. violation the prp has failed to conduct the actions approved for all three iras at the site. for 20011634 (napl), he has failed to gauge and bail napl according to the schedule approved by the department, for several past periods of time and again most recently since july 2003. for 20011667 (the pcb contamination to the north of the site) the prp has repeatedly failed to maintain a fence that restricts access between the actively used employee parking lot and the surficial soils containing imminent hazard concentrations of pcbs. this failure was most recently documented during the departments december 9, 2003 site visit. finally, for 20014355, (pcb contamination on the south end of the site) the department specifically required that the area of pcb contamination be delineated, that that area be restricted with chain link fencing, and that an imminent hazard evaluation pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0950 be conducted. none of these requirements were met by the prp. therefore, the prp violated 310 cmr 40.0420. d. failure to submit ira status reports 1. law 310 cmr 40.0425 status reports on immediate response actions (1) unless otherwise specified in writing by the department, a person conducting immediate response actions shall submit a written status report to the department 120 days after the date on which that person first communicated to the department his or her intention to conduct that immediate response action. (2) following submission of the first such status report, additional status reports shall be submitted to the department every six months thereafter, until such time as an immediate response action completion report is submitted to the department, as described in 310 cmr 40.0427. 2. fact the department received the first ira status report for 20011634 and 20011667 combined on july 14, 1997. subsequent ira status report were not submitted within the required deadlines, and no ira status report were received between march 12, 1998 and 2001. in april 2001 the department issued an to the prp, including this violation. ira status reports were then received on july 20, 2001, january 3, 2002, july 30, 2002 (starting with this report, 20014355 is included as well), october 18, 2002, and january 10, 2003. the ira status reports required for all three release tracking numbers on july 20, 2003 and january 20, 2004 have not been submitted. 3. violation the prp has failed to submit the required ira status report for all three of the ira conditions at the site, therefore, the prp has violated 310 cmr 40.0425.acopce053a012 6 e. failure to meet the performance standard for phase it 1. law 310 cmr 40.0833 performance standards (phase ii) (1) a phase ii comprehensive site assessment shall collect, develop and evaluate sufficient information to support conclusions and opinions regarding (a) the source, nature, extent, and potential impacts of releases of oil andor hazardous material (b) the risk of harm posed by the disposal site to health, safety, public welfare and the environment and (c) the need to conduct remedial actions at the disposal site. 2. fact the department received phase ii comprehensive site assessment (csa) report on july 1, 2002. the phase it csa was deficient. most importantly the extent of the release was not delineated. also, the report does not include an imminent hazard evaluation pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0950. rather, it simply states that an imminent hazard is present but has been abated with a fence, despite the repeatedly documented inadequacy of the fence on the northern portion of the site, and the lack of delineation of the imminent hazard conditions on the southern portion of the site. other deficiencies included that the report considered only pcb as a contaminant of concern, and did not address the lead, total petroleum hydrocarbons, and chlorinated volatile organic compounds detected at the site. the phase ii assumes that the site is not accessible to workers, though the departments site observations have been otherwise, and does not consider the scenario of trespassers on the site. though utilities are present on the northern part of the site in the vicinity of pcb hot spots, the phase ii discounts them as migration pathways with no supporting information. 3. violation the prp submitted a phase if csa which neither delineates the extent of the release nor provides the required information regarding the risk posed by the release. therefore, the prp violated 310 cmr 40.0833(1). f, failure to meet response action deadlines 1. law 310 cmr40.0550 response action deadlines and requirements for tier i disposal sites (1) deadlines for response action outcomes. except as expressly provided by 310 cmr 40.0530(6) or 310 cmr 40.0000 or as otherwise ordered or agreed to in writing by the department, any person undertaking response actions at a tier i disposal site pursuant to a tier i permit, as described in 310 cmr 40.0700, shall achieve a response action outcome pursuant to 310 cmr 40.1000 within

otherwise ordered or agreed to in writing by the department, any person undertaking response actions at a tier i disposal site pursuant to a tier i permit shall submit the following documents to the department by the following deadlines (a) ascope of work for a phase it comprehensive site assessment pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0834 prior to the implementation of phase ii field work, unless the phase ii field work had been implemented prior to tier classification (b) phase ii report, and, if applicable, a phase ii remedial action plan within two years of the effective date of such permit (c) a

of such permit and e) any other submittal as required by the terms and conditions of a tier i permit pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0740. 2. fact the department issued the prp a tier ib permit for this site, which he accepted, and which became effective on december 8, 1997. a phase ii csa and phase iii remedial action plan (rap) were required by december 8, 1999, a phase tv remedy implementation plan (rip) by december 8, 2000, and a response action outcome statement (rao) by december 8, 2002. on april 27, 2001, the department issued a to the prp for violations including failure to submit the required phase ii, ii, and iv reports. the prp submitted and the department approved a proposal for returning to compliance which included the following phase ij soil assessment and sensitive receptor survey by 41502 e phase ii groundwater assessment and imminent hazard evaluation by 51502 e submittal of a phase if csa by 7102 e submittal of a phase iii rap by 71502 and, e submittal of a phase iv rip and rao within deadlines to be established in a conditional permit extension. according to the prps submittals, the deadlines for completion of the soil and groundwater investigations were not met (these investigations were not even initiated until after the completion deadlines had passed). an imminent hazard evaluation pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0950 has yet to be conducted for the site, though repeatedly requested by the department. a report entitled phase ii csa was submitted on july 1, 2002. however it did not meet the performance standards for a phase if csa. a phase iii rap was submitted on july 15, 2002. however it explicitly excluded release tracking 2 . 0014355, issued for an ira condition associated with this release.acopce053a012 8 a conditional permit extension was issued in december 2002, which established deadlines for the completion of a phase iv rip by march 1, 2003 and a rao by march 1, 2004. the prp accepted this permit extension. the phase iv rip was not submitted within the deadline, but was submitted late, after repeatedly requested by the department, on april 29, 2003. according to the lsp of record, during july 2003, the prp had ceased authorizing the consultant to conduct any work at the site. the prp did not submit the required rao by march 1, 2004. 3. violation the prp has failed to meet his response action deadlines and has received an for this violation. he has been late for subsequent submittals according to his proposed schedule for returning to compliance, and he has failed to submit the imminent hazard evaluation in 2002 as proposed. the prp has failed to submit the rao as required by march 1, 2004. therefore, the prp has violated 310 cmr 40.0550. 5. the parties have agreed to enter into this consent order because they

asts removal and disposal. marvin cut one of the asts and allegedly dumped the oily sludge to the soil basement floor and removed that cut tank from the property. marvin noted to respondent that the other ast had oil inside and he would not be able to remove it. . respondent was conducting other work in the basement at the site on february 15, 2012 and noted an oil odor, and assumed it was related to the unknown volume of sludge marvin dumped on the soil basement floor. on february 17, 2012, respondents employees on the first floor of the site called respondents maintenance department to complain of oil odors in the building. respondent inspected the basement and noted an oil odor in the basement and that the oil feed line on the remaining ast was leaking. respondent used air fresheners to mitigate the oil odors, excavated some of the contaminated soil under the tank, and applied absorbent to the basement floor. . respondents employees on the first floor again complained to respondents maintenance department about the odor of oil at the site. respondent contacted commonwealth tank to remove from the basement at the site and properly dispose of the remaining ast. commonwealth tank removed the ast, and provided respondent with a report stating that there was significant staining on soil in the basement and that the ast had been leaking from the bottom. during the removal of the ast, commonwealth tank removed and disposed of about 50 gallons of oil and 5 gallons of sludge from the ast. respondents senior officials toured the site on february 22, 2012 and

for the site on july 22, 1994. b. on march 30, 2000, respondent submitted a method 1 risk characterization for the site as part of a phase ii site assessment addendum. at the time of the risk characterization, the respondent noted that there were several wells in the proximity of the site that had groundwater concentrations exceeding the gw2 standards. however, the risk characterization concluded that, because the building was unoccupied, the gw2 standards were inapplicable. the risk characterization concluded there was not a potential indoor air pathway based on the fact that the building was vacant. c. subsequent to the submission of the risk characterization described in paragraph 5b, a woodworking tenant came to occupy, and currently occupies, the main building on the site, thereby changing the site conditions upon which the initial risk characterization was based. d. pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0893(2)e, in order to achieve and maintain remedy operation status (ros) at the site, the respondent is required to demonstrate, through a substantial hazard evaluation, that any substantial hazards have been eliminated. as set forth in 310 cmr 40.0956(1), the focus of a substantial hazard evaluation shall be on possible exposures to human and environmental receptors, considering the current use of the site and surrounding environment. in order to maintain ros at the site, respondent must also maintain a condition of no substantial hazard. e. on october 30, 2003, respondent submitted a remedy operation status (ros) submittal. the ros submittal did not include a substantial hazard evaluation prepared in accordance with 310 cmr 40.0956 that addressed the potential exposure pathways at the site, including those pathways associated with the current tenant and the storage of hazardous waste, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0893(2)e. since its initial ros submittal, respondent has never updated or revised its risk characterization to reflect the changed conditions at the site, thereby continuing its violation of 310 cmr 40.0893(2)e. f. the remedial action conducted by the respondent under ros at the site includes the application of remedial additives (potassium permanganate and sodium permanganate) to the subsurface in order to chemically oxidize the chlorinated solvent contamination in groundwater. while some groundwater monitoring of the remedial additives has been conducted as part of this process, the respondent has failed to sample an upgradient monitoring well, underlying wells, and representative ro fife fetes coee ee ecttteme re

groundwater monitoring activities for remedial additives every three months constitutes a violation of 310 cmr 40.0046(4)(c). g. on january 23, 2007, while auditing the response actions at the site, massdep conducted a site inspection and observed thirtyfour, 55gallon drums in the facility. based on minimal labeling information and information obtained from respondents consultant during the inspection, some of the drums appeared to be remediation waste, including spent carbon from a remedial system which operated at the site prior to 2001. h. subsequent to attending an enforcement conference at massdeps central regional office on june 7, 2007, respondent sampled and characterized the content of the drums. respondent determined that 20 drums contained soil generated during assessment activities at the site 12 drums contained remediation waste, specifically, spent carbon contaminated with volatile organic compounds and two drums contained hazardous waste of unknown origin. this information was submitted to massdep in a letter report dated july 13, 2007. i. prior to closure of the site in 1988, respondent operated the facility as a small quantity generator (sqg) pursuant to 310 cmr 30.000. as a sqg, respondent was required to label and mark the drums located at the site. as discovered during the january 23, 2007 site inspection, none of the drums were adequately labeled and marked, in violation of 310 cmr 30.341(2), as referred to by 310 cmr 30.351(8)(a). j. pursuant to 310 cmr 30.351(6)(c), a sqg, such as the respondent, who accumulates hazardous waste in excess of 180 days must comply with the licensing requirements applicable to a hazardous waste storage facility. respondents failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a violation

in remedy operation status (ros). the selected remedy consisted of soil vapor extraction (sve)air sparging (as), monitored natural attenuation (mna), included operation of a bedrock groundwater pump and treatment system, and operation and maintenance of eight (8) point of entry treatment (poet) systems on potable wells in the vicinity. the remedy was installed and implemented in 1999. the assve remedial system was deactivated in 2002 after the remedial objectives for this the remedy were achieved. originally, remedial wastewater from the bedrock groundwater pump and treatment system was discharged to surface water under a national pollutant discharge elimination system (npdes) exclusion permit issued by the environmental protection agency (epa). . in january 2006, the epa issued the site remediation general permit (rgp) mag910186. however, the treatment system encountered difficulties meeting the new rgp discharge requirements for iron. in october 2007, massdep received a phase iv remedy implementation plan (rip) modification which documented the redirection of treatment system discharge into the onsite former sve piping network. although the sve piping network was not originally designed as a groundwater infiltration gallery, limited pilot testing described in the october 2007 rip modification concluded that the sve piping network met the design criteria for repurposed use as a groundwater infiltration gallery. subsequent focused monitoring near the infiltration gallery (described in the august 8, 2009 ros status report) confirmed that the sve piping network was adequate for use as a groundwater infiltration gallery. however, between 2009 and november 2013, the infiltration gallery (i.e., he former sve piping) fouled with iron, causing frequent backpressure fault shutdowns of the remediation system and repetitive surficial breakouts of remedial wastewater, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0893(2)(c) and 310 cmr 40.0045(1)(a). . the ros report, received by the department on january 31, 2014, documented that the bedrock groundwater pump and treatment was deactivated on november 14, 2013, due to continued breakout of treated water at the reinjection locations. this notification of system deactivation was not provided within thirty (30) days, as required by 310 cmr 40.0893(6), but was received seventynine (79) days after system deactivation. additionally, the report indicated that respondent was evaluating alternatives for discharging treated water, but did not provide a plan or timetable for returning the system to operational status within one hundred twenty (120) days, nor was the ros terminated, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0893(6). . on june 12, 2014, massdep received a release abatement measure (ram) plan

(santander). the third property is 402 grove street, owned by altab and the location of a single story restaurant building. the santander driveway bifurcates the 400 grove street and 402 grove street parcels. groundwater is believed to generally flow in a northwest to southeast direction. b. the site was first identified as a location to be investigated in 1989 due to historic petroleum contamination associated with former service station operations at the 400 grove street property and was assigned . chlorinated hydrocarbons were subsequently identified in soil and groundwater on all three parcels. c. in february 2007, an imminent hazard was identified due to elevated concentrations of tetrachloroethylene in indoor air at the 400 grove street building and was mitigated by the installation of a subslab venting system and periodic indoor air quality sampling to ensure effectiveness of exposure pathway control. this release was assigned . d. on april 14, 2010, a temporary solution intended to achieve a permanent solution was submitted for the 400 grove street and 402 grove street portions of the site. the plan to achieve a permanent solution for the 400 grove and 402 grove street parcels relied upon implementation of a proposed chemical oxidation remediation system conducted by santander despite santanders stated intentions in its own separate remedial plan to limit remedial application principally to the driveway portion of the site owned by santander. e. on july 14, 2010, santander submitted a partial permanent solution for the driveway portion of the

(santander). the third property is 402 grove street, owned by altab and the location of a single story restaurant building. the santander driveway bifurcates the 400 grove street and 402 grove street parcels. groundwater is believed to generally flow in a northwest to southeast direction. . the site was first identified as a location to be investigated in 1989 due to historic petroleum contamination associated with former service station operations at the 400 grove street property and was assigned . chlorinated hydrocarbons were subsequently identified in soil and groundwater on all three parcels. . in february 2007, an imminent hazard was identified due to elevated concentrations of tetrachloroethylene in indoor air at the 400 grove street building and was mitigated by the installation of a subslab venting system and periodic indoor air quality sampling to ensure effectiveness of exposure pathway control. this release was assigned . . on april 14, 2010, a temporary solution intended to achieve a permanent solution was submitted for the 400 grove street and 402 grove street portions of the site. the plan to achieve a permanent solution for the 400 grove and 402 grove street parcels relied upon implementation of a proposed chemical oxidation remediation system conducted by santander despite santanders stated intentions in its own separate remedial plan to limit remedial application principally to the driveway portion of the site owned by santander. . on july 14, 2010, santander submitted a partial permanent solution for the driveway portion of the site, indicating that there would be no further operation of the remediation system by the bank. by relying on a system operated by a third party that was limited in scope both geographically and

company, inc. acopce063a015 page 2 of 7 a the following facts have led massdep to issue this consent order a. respondent referenced its water supply as a private water supply well in multiple submittals to massdep when it is, although privatelyowned and operated, a public water system (pws), as defined under 310 cmr 22.02. therefore, massdep alleges that respondent made inaccurate statements in its submittals, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0022(2). specifically, the pws well was referenced as one of several private drinking water wells in the vicinity of the site sic in the following submittals phase i report submitted november 1, 2001 and immediate response action (ira) status reports dated january 8, 2001, june 1, 2001, and november 7, 2001. furthermore, respondent referenced the pws as a private water supply well in the following submittals ira plans submitted april 30, 2002, april 23, 2004, and november 30, 2004 ira status reports submitted october 30, 2002, april 28, 2003, and july 9, 2004 the phase ii scope of work submitted september 30, 2003 the phase ii comprehensive site assessment report dated november 23, 2004. the march 24, 2005 phase iii remedial action plan correctly described the well as an unregistered pws, however, the subsequent june 8, 2005 ira status report reverted to the statement the property is served by a private water supply well. b. massdep alleges that respondent failed to notify massdep within 72 hours of obtaining knowledge of a substantial release migration (srm) condition in violation of 310 cmr 40.0313(5). massdep alleges that detection of siterelated contamination in a pws well constitutes a srm condition as defined at 310 cmr 40.0006 and that 310 cmr 40.0313(5) required respondent to provide oral notification to massdep immediately and no later than 72hours from obtaining knowledge of the srm. the impact of the release on private water supply wells had been included as part of the siterelated information collected and described in 2000 and 2001, and these conditions were addressed under an immediate response action (ira) plan.. however, siterelated contamination of the pws well was first detected in a sample collected from the pws in march 2003. the contamination was confirmed in five subsequent sampling events in april 2003, july 2003, october 2003, february 2004, and september 2004. massdep was onsite during the sampling in april 2003, and the issue of srm was not raised by massdep in the may 27, 2003 notice of audit finding. from the time of detection of contamination in the pws in march 2003 until the submittal of an ira plan modification in november 2004, respondent took no action to eliminate or mitigate this critical exposure pathway during the performance of its ira as required by 310 cmr 40.0414(3). respondent did not provide separate srm notification with respect to the pws well until specifically requested to do so during an audit inspection conducted by massdep on december 8, 2004. as directed by massdep, respondent notified massdep of the srm for the pws well on december 10, 2004. c. massdep alleges that respondent failed to submit a timely revised tier classification submittal in violation of 310 cmr 40.0530. respondent submitted a tier classification submittal in 2001, which stated that there were no surface waterwetlands within 500 feet. subsequently, respondent submitted a revised tier classification submittal in novemberin the matter of peterborough oil company, inc. acopce063a015 page 3 of 7 2004, asserting that the site classification must be changed from tier ii to tier ic as a result of detections in a stream 100 feet from the release. the detection of mtbe in the stream first occurred on february 17, 2004, and was confirmed on march 3, 2004. subsequent sampling during april, may, june and september 2004 indicated transient detections of mtbe. the respondent alleges that such detections could have been indicative of an impact by runoff from the nearby roadway, however, massdep alleges that respondent did not conduct an investigation to gather the necessary data to support this allegation either within the sixtyday time period or subsequently. therefore pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0530, massdep alleges that rescoring was required within sixty days of the first detection, ie., by april 18, 2004. respondent did submit the revised tier classification submittal on november 23, 2004. d. because the numerical ranking system (nrs) scoresheet submitted with the revised tier classification in november 2004 did not acknowledge or score for the presence of the pws well at the site, failed to recognize the inclusionary criterion of the interim wellhead protection area (iwpa), and scored zero points for the presence of indoor air contamination, massdep alleges that respondent violated 310 cmr 40.0520(1). in november 2000, gasoline vapors were reported in the basement and well vault of the adjacent package store. up to 7 (in the basement) and up to 15 (in the well vault) of the lower explosive limit (lel) were measured by lel meter. a soil vapor extraction system (sves) was installed november 2000 and operated until august 2002. following deactivation of the system, indoor air was monitored using a photoionization detector (pid) and lel meter. pid and lel readings were low with a maximum of 0.6 parts per million (ppm), however, no laboratory analysis of indoor air was conducted to confirm that indoor air was not impacted by the release in order to support the score of zero for indoor air contamination. at massdeps request, in january 2005, indoor air samples were collected and analyzed in the basement and the first floor. contamination was detected in excess of established background levels only in the first floor, for two hydrocarbon fractions that were not detected in excess of established background levels in the basement sample and that had not been detected in groundwater samples since 2000. 310 cmr 40.0520(1) required that respondent score the site using the nrs as described in 310 cmr 40.1500, based upon data, facts and other information obtained during phase i, and any other relevant data, facts or information known by respondent. therefore, at the time of the tier classification, massdep alleges that the respondent should have acknowledged the pws well and that the potential for indoor air contamination also should have been included. e. respondent has failed to meet response action deadlines in violation of 310 cmr 40.0560(2). the site was originally tier classified by respondent as tier ii on november 1, 2001. as described at 310 cmr 40.0560(2), a phase ii comprehensive site assessment and phase iii remedial action plan were required by november 1, 2003 and a phase iv remedy implementation plan was required by november 1, 2004. on october 28, 2003, a notice of delay letter was submitted for respondent in accordance with 310 cmr 40.0560(5). the phase ii and iii reports were submitted more than a year late on november 23, 2004, and march 24, 2005 respectively. the phase ivin the matter of peterborough oil company, inc.

facts and allegations have led massdep to issue this consent order a. respondent submitted a class c rao and phase iv final inspection report with massdep on november 12, 2003.. in this submittal the lsp stated that on september 30, 2003, ain the matter of pintos plumbing heating supply, inc. acopce093a004 page 2 of 9 layer of black semisolid tar material was encountered during excavation of a storm water drainage system. subsequent testing of this material revealed high concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) and extractable petroleum hydrocarbons (eph). these pah and eph concentrations exceeded rcs1 and upper concentration limits (ucls). respondents consultant concluded the black tar material was coal tar that likely originated at a former coal gasification plant located at 11 beach street, which abuts the site to the northeast. previous investigations had identified pahs in several soil samples at concentrations several orders of magnitude lower than in the coal tar area. coal tar was not previously identified at the site. the november 12, 2003 submittal states that since pahs were previously detected, the discovery of coal tar was not a new condition, and therefore, notification was not necessary. because coal tar had never before been encountered at the site, and concentration of pahs were inconsistent with those previously detected, these conditions represented a separate release. respondent was required to notify massdep of this release via the submittal of a release notification form within 120 days of its obtaining knowledge. failure to notify of concentrations of pahs and eph in soil greater than rcs1 is a violation of 310 cmr 40.0315(1). b. as summarized in the november 12, 2003, submittal, respondents contractor excavated one hundred seventeen (117) tons of coal tarcontaminated soil and transported it offsite in october 2003. respondent was required to notify massdep of the new release prior to conducting remedial actions. conducting remedial response actions prior to providing notification to massdep of the release is a violation of 310 cmr 40.0404(4). c. the class c rao relied upon a method 3 risk characterization that was included in the november 13, 2000, phase ii comprehensive site assessment to conclude that a condition of no substantial hazard existed at the site. in the method 3 risk characterization, potential risk to human health posed by volatilization of chlorinated hydrocarbons from groundwater into indoor was evaluated. concentrations of . contaminants in indoor air were estimated by using the johnson ettinger (je) model, which predicted indoor air concentrations that would not pose a substantial hazard. in 2006, changes were made to the je model that required development of chemical specific attenuation factors, which could result in the prediction of higher indoor air concentrations. therefore, assessment of indoor air impacts should have been reevaluated using the updated je model inputs, or by collection of soil gas or indoor air samples. failure to demonstrate that a condition of no substantial hazard continues to be met in order to maintain the class c rao is a violation of 310 cmr 40.0897(3).in the matter of pintos plumbing heating supply, inc. acopce093a004 page 3 of 9 d. respondent submitted a limited subsurface assessment with massdep on

inc. by virtue of a massachusetts quitclaim deed, recorded with the worcester district registry of deeds at book 35448, page 384, referencing the aul as required by 310 cmr 40.1074(5). on may 17, 2012, massdep personnel observed a skidsteer loader (i.e. bobcat) and evidence of recent soil movement at the site. the sites tenant, patrick sullivan (site tenant) of worcester photo studios, llc, confirmed that he was moving soil to regrade the site. stockpiled soil was observed at the site. the site tenant stated that he was aware of residual fuel oil contamination at the site, and that he had permission from respondent to conduct the work. when massdep personnel inquired of respondent regarding the site tenants activities, respondent stated that he was unaware of and had not provided permission for the site tenant to conduct excavation and grading of soil. . the aul identifies obligations and conditions set forth in the aul opinion to include a requirement that excavation of contaminated soils should be performed by properly informed personnel under an osha hazard communication program with appropriate access controls. the aul notes in several places requirements relative to permitted and inconsistent site activities and uses, and obligations and conditions to limit exposure to soil contamination, but does not clearly state for purposes of risk communication where soil contamination is located on the site (e.g. at depths of three feet below grade or more), thereby indicating that all soil within the aul area must be considered contaminated unless shown otherwise, as

location on site and notes the sample with the highest reported levels of tph and perce (s11) was collected from a limited area of soils situated beneath a large tree that was being undermined, and therefore, those soils were left in place. concentrations of tph (i.e. total petroleum hydrocarbons) and perc (i.e. tetrachloroethylene) in soil sample s11 were detected at 9,500 mgkg and 260 mgkg,

s11 was observed during massdeps audit inspection on may 17, 2012, to have been disturbed and moved. the large tree referenced in the rao statement, and shown on figure 3.0 of the rao statement, was no longer located onsite. oo the onsite construction work was performed without an osha hazard communication plan, as required by the aul. the site tenant, mr. sullivan, is not osha hazwoper trained as properly informed personnel. therefore, the onsite construction work was performed without adhering to the aul requirements, in violation of 310 cmr 40.1070(2). as aresult of the observations made during the may 17, 2012 inspection, massdep required that respondent andor site tenant obtain an lsp opinion to characterize stockpiled soils, in accordance with aul obligations and conditions that soils excavated from the area identified as the location of contaminated soil should be tested and, if warranted, treated pursuant to the appropriate state and federal waste disposal regulations, and to develop a health and safety plan to continue soil grading work. the respondent was also informed that all soils must be stockpiled on and covered with plastic sheeting, and that any stockpiled soils must be enclosed with a snow fence to restrict access by neighborhood children. . on june 4, 2012, massdep issued separate requests for information (rfis) to respondent and the site tenant. the rfi responses revealed conflicting accounts of the site tenants knowledge of the aul requirements. respondent stated that the site tenant was provided a copy of the aul and made aware of the aul by inclusion in the lease for the site. the site tenant stated that he had no knowledge of the aul. on july 11, 2012, respondent provided a copy of the lease to massdep. the lease does not reference the aul, in violation of 310 cmr 40.1074(5). in addition, the lease fails to state that the site tenant must implement and adhere to the auls requirements, which is also a violation of 310 cmr 40.1070(2) and is required by paragraph 6 of the aul. . the stockpiled soil has subsequently been observed by massdep to be partially covered or uncovered on several occasions since the initial audit inspection.

presence of a subsurface napl having a measured thickness equal to or greater than vg inch and less than inch are violations of 310 cmr 40.0315(1) and 310 cmr 40.0315(4), respectively. i. on november 22, 2008, an indoor air sample was collected from the release area in the basement and submitted for laboratory analysis of air petroleum hydrocarbons (aph) via massdep aph protocol. t he results of november 2008 indoor air analyses indicated the presence of aph and a chlorinated volatile organic compoimnd (cvoc) in the basement of the onsite residential building. aa the detection of aph fractions and a cvoc in indoor air during the november 22, 2008 indoor air sampling event constituted a condition requiring notification within 72 hours as required by 310 cmr 40.0313(5). respondent did not notify massdep of the detection of aph and cvoc concentrations in indoor air at a residence. failure to notify massdep of a 72hour notification condition consisting of a condition of substantial release migration (srm) as indicated by a release to the groundwater that has resulted in the discharge of vapors into an occupied residential dwelling is a violation of 310 cmr 40.0313(5). k, the srm 72hour notification condition required an immediate response action (ira) to be conducted, as stipulated in 3 10 cmr 40.0412(2) and 310 cmr 40.0414(3), to eliminate andor mitigate a critical exposure pathway (cep), the route by which the vaporphase emissions of oil andor hazardous material are transported into the living or working space of the occupied residential dwelling. an ira was not conducted to eliminate andor mitigate the cep at the disposal site, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0412(2) and 310 cmr 40.0414(3). in addition, technical justification was not provided to demonstrate that the cep does not and will not, for the time period that is likely to be required for the implementation andor completion of comprehensivein the matter of timothy orourke and margaret orourke acopce113a006 page 4 of 12 response actions, present an imminent hazard and it is not feasible to eliminate or mitigate the cep as specified by 310 cmr 40.0414 (3)(a), (b) and (c). l. on december 1, 2008, massdep received a combined phase ii completion statement, phase iii completion statement, ram completion statement, and a revised tier classification submitted by respondent. the phase ii contained a screeninglevel evaluation of human health risk posed by certain volatile contaminants detected in indoor air utilizing madeps imminent hazard evaluation for rsident exposed in chemicals in indoor air short form 2006. the evaluation used exposure point concentrations (epc) equivalent to the maximum concentration of aph compounds measured in the basement indoor air which resulted in a hazard index of 1.0. naphthalene and tce were not included in the risk assessment as contaminants of concern, and a technical justification was not supplied for the omission. m. the phase ii selected method 1 as the risk characterization approach for the site based on the assumptions that impact was limited to soil and groundwater, and human receptors would potentially be exposed predominantly through contact with soil and groundwater. the phase ii inappropriately used method 1 tocharacterize risk at the disposal site, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0942(1)(b), as oil and hazardous material (i.e. aph and cvoc) were present in an environmental medium (i.e. indoor air) in addition to soil and groundwater. further, the phase ii failed to demonstrate that human receptors could potentially be exposed predominantly through contact with soil and groundwater as specified in 310 cmr 40.0942(1)(b)1., given the dwelling utilized a fieldstone foundation, and the fact that contaminated soil and groundwater were located at depth in front of the residence and below the concrete basement floor. . n. the december 2008 revised tier classification reduced the overall site numerical ranking system (nrs) score from 288 to 272, and thereby did not identify a need to change the tier classification. the revised ranking kept the indoor air exposure . pathway rank at 100 based on the assertion that a potential exposur e pathway existed for aph fractions reported in indoor air at concentrations below the 90 percentile threshold values of typical indoor air concentrations for the reported compounds. in fact, the results of november 2008 indoor air analyses indicated the presence of aph and a chlorinated volatile organic compound (cvoc) in the basement at concentrations above the threshold values at which multiple lines of evidence are required as provided in table 1 of madeps indoor air threshold values for the evaluation of a vapor intrusion pathway draft technical update policy 08xxx, madep, june 26, 2008. the following compounds exceeded the thresholds identified in table 1 cs5cg aromatics at 110 ugm, cocj2 aliphatics at 160 ugm, and c5 cio aromatics at 23 ugm. further, the detection limit of naphthalene at 2.0 ugm and detection of a cvoc, trichloroethylene (tce), at 22 ugm also exceeded respective thresholds. despite exceeding thresholds, an evaluation utilizing multiple lines of evidence was not provided to demonstrate that a vapor intrusion pathway did not exist.in the matter of timothy orourke and margaret orourke acopce113a006 page 5 of 12 the nrs revision failed to identify a confirmed exposure pathway and assign a value of 200 to the indoor air confirmed pathway as substantiated by the existence of aph and cvoc above background, in violation of 310 cmr 40.15 12(4). in addition, a tier i permit was not submitted to massdep within 60 days of rescoring, in violation of 310 cmr 40,0530(2), and work at the disposal site progressed without a tier i permit, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0702(4). . o. on february 17, 2009, massdep received a phase iv remedy implementation plan (rip). the rip presented a schedule for implementing the selected remedial alternative which called for monthly enhanced fluid recovery (efr) events, and quarterly groundwater and indoor air sampling to begin in march 2009. the initial efr and monitoring frequency would continue for the first six months, with subsequent activities consisting of efr events as necessary, and long term quarterly monitoring until a class c response action outcome (rao), at a minimum, is achieved. in addition, the february 2009 phase iv rip did not contain a health and safety plan, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0874(3) (). p. general provisions for phase iv responseactions were not met at the disposal site, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0871(6), as the phased iv implementation did not conform to the proposals and specifications contained in the rip one efr event was conducted on august 25, 2009, and groundwaterindoor air was last monitored prior to the phase iv rip. in addition, phase iv status reports addressing a srm condition have not been submitted monthly, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0877(1) (a). q. on august 25, 2009, massdep conducted an audit inspection at the disposal site. r. on june 1, 2020, massdep issued a notice of enforcement conference and conducted an enforcement conference with respondent on june 15, 2010. s. respondent submitted an application for financial inability

petroleum impacted mill brook. worcester dphce identified the contamination as having originated from behind the subject property. massdep issued a notice of responsibility on the same day to mr. dennis smith of lindberg heat treating co. for the release of 250 gallons of quench oil. the release resulted from a holding tank overfill and impacted the parking lot, a storm drain, and mill brook. b. on july 23, 1991, massdep received correspondence from mr. dennis smith of lindberg heat treating co. notifying massdep of the detection of unspecified petroleum hydrocarbons in soil samples taken from the subject property. the sampling was conducted during the closure and abandonment of two fuel oil tanks beneath a building at the subject property. c. on august 19, 1998, massdep was notified by the worcester dphce that a release of petroleum impacted mill brook, and identified the contamination as having originated from behind the subject property. an oil fingerprint analysis confirmed the presence of 6 fuel oil in mill brook. massdep issued a notice of responsibility on september 29, 1998, to mr. martin lee of lindberg heat treating co. for the release of 6 fuel oil emanating from the lindberg property and impacting mill brook. d. on november 2, 1998, massdep received correspondence from mr. stephen sakakenny, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering on behalf of lindberg heat treating co. notifying massdep of the intent to evaluate evidence of oil contamination to determine if.a notification condition exists pursuant to the mcp. on december 8, 1998, capaccio employed an oil fingerprint analysis of a grab sample from the mill brook culvert which identified 2 fuel oil as having emanated from the site. e. on march 15, 1999, massdep issued a notice of responsibility (nor) to mr. martin lee of lindberg heat treating co. for the release of oil to the soil andor groundwater at the subject property, and massdep assigned release tracking number 20012660 to the disposal site. the nor cited the july 23, 1991 correspondence identifying petroleum hydrocarbons in soils at the site, and the august 19, 1998 occurrence of 6 fuel oil in mill brook as evidence that a release of oil has occurred at the site and a condition of substantial release migration (srm) may be present. the nor required evaluation of notification conditions and, at a minimum, formal notification of a release of oil to the soil by april 15, 1999. f, on march 19, 1999, mr. sakakenny verbally notified massdep that a release of 6 fuel oil to a storm drain occurred at the site as evidenced by oil having impacted the mill brook culvert. during the march 19, 1999 verbal notification mr. sakakenny stated that no srm condition was present as the opening to the culvert was plugged

the source of contamination as an abandoned in place 3,000 gallon 2 fuel oil tank referred to in the aforementioned july 23, 1991 lindberg heat treating correspondence. g, respondent conducted response actions under beginning with an immediate response action (ira) on march 19, 1999. a biological degradation enhancing treatment system with integrated nonaqueous phase liquid (napl) recovery was proposed as an immediate response action on november 3, 2000. massdep issued a written approval letter for the plan on december 21, 2000. further assessment activities included soil and groundwater sampling, and water table gauging. h. respondents comprehensive response action implemented to achieve a permanent solution at the disposal site consists of a napl recovery and insitu biological treatment system. groundwater is extracted from a recovery trench, napl separated from the groundwater in fractionating drums, and the groundwater is treated with nutrients prior to discharge in an onsite recharge trench. i. the groundwater treatment system removes napl from the extracted groundwater by fractionating the napl in three open drums connected in series which reside in a treatment shed. treatment system maintenance personnel remove napl floating in the fractionation drums by applying hydrophobic petroleum absorbent pads to the napl and collecting the petroleum saturated pads in a fivegallon pail. the napl and contaminated media are transported to a hazardous waste accumulation area in the fivegallon collection pail and handled with the facility hazardous waste stream in accordance with 310 cmr 30.0000. j. on july 30,2008, massdep conducted an audit inspection of response actions at the site. k. subsequent to the july 30, 2008 site inspection, massdep

thermal processing, inc. acopce093a019 page 4 of 14 m during the july 30, 2008 site inspection, massdep staff identified several violations of the management procedures for remediation waste at the site 1) the fivegallon remediation waste collection pail was not labeled in accordance with 310 cmr 40.0031(1) and 310 cmr 30.682. 2) the fivegallon remediation waste collection pail lacked a cover and contained remediation waste from previous napl removal events. the remediation waste container was not kept closed during storage of the remediation waste from. previous events, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0031(1) and 310 cmr 30.685(1). 3) as the remediation waste container lacked a cover, the container could not be sealed prior to transfer to the accumulation area, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0031(1) and 310 cmr 30.685(1). 4) the remediation waste collection pail which contained remediation waste from previous napl removal events was stored in an accumulation area located in the treatment shed which was not posted with signage as required by 310 cmr 40.0031(1) and 40.0036(1), 310 cmr 30.341(4) and 30.253(6). 5) the remediation waste accumulation area located in the treatment shed was not clearly marked with fencing, gate or tape to clearly distinguish it from areas where wastes are not stored, in violation of 310 cmr 40. eta and 40.0036(1), and 310 cmr 30.341(5). n. during the july 30, 2008 site inspection, massdep audit staff noted the onsite inspection log to be in poor condition and contained gaps in inspection and maintenance from february to july, 2008. the september 19, 2008 capaccio rfi response included inspection notes taken by an alternate site technician who logged the site visit information in an offsite log and omitted recording information in the onsite log from february to july 2008. failure to keep maintenance and inspection log books and records in the available secure onsite building 1s a violation of 310 cmr 40.0041(6)(d). o. the september 19, 2008 rfi response did not provide requested information documenting a final electrical inspection for the construction of the treatment shed and associated wiring for the groundwater treatment system. failure to obtain a building permit and associated inspection from the city of worcester code inspection department constitutes failure to construct and install such works in a manner adequate to protect health, safety, public welfare, and the environment, and in compliance with m.g.l. c. 21e and 310 cmr 40.0000 and is therefore a violation of 310 cmr 40.0041(5). p. question

capaccio environmental engineering, inc. the supplemental rfi response states that as of may 2001, capaccio staff determined 310 cmr 40.0041(9), which requires quarterly wwto inspections, was not applicable as the system meets the exemption outlined as being a discharge of remedial additives. the response states further that voluntary site inspection of the remedial system will be conducted by capaccio on a periodic basis, and the inspections were initiated during november 2008. subsequent to the audit inspection, massdep determined that the groundwater treatment system removing napl from the extracted groundwater prior to treatment with nutrients and discharge does not meet the aforementioned exemption. therefore, respondent was required to perform quarterly wwto inspections, and the failure to do so is in violation of 310 cmr 40.0041(9). k massdep received a phase iii report, dated july 2002, which was prepared by stephen sakakeeny, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc. figures 4 and 5 of the phase iii depict a planar layout view of the groundwater extraction and recharge galleries, and a planar cross sectional view of the petroleum release conceptual model respectively. taken together, the figures show groundwater extraction and recharge occur downgradient of the source identified as an abandoned in place 3,000 gallon 2 fuel oil tank, located under the southern portion of the east end of the facility building. with the exception of one report, all groundwater contour maps included in remedy operation status reports, recetved by massdep since august 2004, depict groundwater mounding centered at the recharge gallery downgradient of the source. the groundwater mounding depicted in the groundwater contour maps show groundwater flow radially from the recharge area sufficient to effectively limit treatment and hydraulic containment to the contaminated area downgradient from the identified source and upgradient from the extraction gallery. s. the documented consistent gradient reversal at the east end of the source area demonstrates a negative impact on efforts to recover napl emanating from the source. the groundwater mound exhibits significant lateral gradient away from the extraction gallery indicating hydraulic containment of the groundwater at the disposal site is not maintained so that the remedial wastewater discharged upgradient of the point of withdrawal has not been contained or recaptured within the boundaries of the disposal site as required by 310 cmr 40.0045(4)(a). inducing a gradient away from thein the matter of bodycote thermal processing, inc. acopce093 a019 page 6 of 14 extraction gallery initiated contaminant transport across the disposal site, thereby exacerbating site conditions and impairing the performance of the treatment system, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0045(4)(d) and as evidenced by napl migration to mw9, formerly upgradient of the source. t. dawn horter, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc. verbally notified massdep at 1240 p.m. on may 5, 2005, of the presence of greater than inch of subsurface napl in mw9 from a source other than the known abandoned 3,000 gallon 2 fuel oil tank. massdep received an ira plan dated july 7, 2005 prepared by dawn horter, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc. the ira plan referred to verbal notification from worldwide geosciences, inc. of houston, texas that a comparison of napl samples from mws4, mws7 and mw11 taken in 2002 with a napl sample from mw9 taken in 2005 indicated the 2002 and 2005 samples were unrelated. u. copies of worldwide geosciences, inc. characterization of product sample reports, dated june 2005 and february 2003, respectively, were received by massdep on march 4, 2009. the february 2003 report characterized samples from the treatment system and two monitoring wells (mws7, mws11) as consistent with severely biodegraded residual fuel oils (5, 6) as the parent product. the sample from the other monitoring well (mws4) was characterized as consistent with a mixture of 2 grade fuel oil, and either an intermediate grade (4) or residual grade (5, 6) fuel oil. the report further states the level of biodegradation for all the four site samples indicates most probable exposure times of twenty years or more. v. the june 2005 worldwide geosciences report indicates a sample from mw9 was a severely biodegraded diesel2 fuel oil product with a probable exposure time of twenty years or more. in addition, the 2005 report states that if 2 grade fuel oil is a component of mws4 sample, the 2 fueloil is a different 2 fuel oil than the 2 dieselfuel product associated with the current mw9 sample. the report further identifies the samples from the treatment system, mws7, and mws11 as consisting predominately of hydrocarbons that are heavier than the hydrocarbons associated with the mw9 sample (diesel2 fuel oil product). w. massdep has reviewed the june 2005. and february 2003 worldwide geosciences, inc. reports and has determined that the reports do not provide sufficient technical justification to demonstrate napl in mw9 has emanated from another source given the proximity to the identified source, gradient relative to the source, and the fact that napl from mw9 has been characterized as the same type and weathered age as product specified for the abandoned 3,000 gallon 2 fueloil tank. x. the worldwide geosciences, inc. characterization of product sample reports, dated june 2005 and february 2003, indicate the existence of contaminant sources other than the identified 3,000 gallon 2 fuel oil tank. the june 2005 report characterizes thein the matter of bodycote thermal processing, inc. acopce093a019 page 7 of 14 treatment system napl sample as consisting predominately of hydrocarbons other than diesel range organics, thereby demonstrating the product recovered by the treatment system since october 2002 has predominantly consisted of a petroleum product other than 2 fuel oil. the conclusions presented in the characterization of product sample reports were of such import that it was necessary to provide additional information to the phase ii report, dated may 24, 2002, prepared by stephen sakakeeny, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc., as required by 310 cmr 40.0835(4), to adequately characterize the disposal site consistent with the response action performance standard described in 310 cmr 40.0191. respondents failure to provide the additional information to the phase ii report is a violation of 310 cmr 40.0835(4). in addition, the may 24, 2002 phase ii report fails to comply with the performance standards for a phase ii report required by 310 cmr 40.0833 (1)(a), by failing to adequately develop and evaluate sufficient information to support conclusions and opinions regarding the source, nature, extent, and potential impacts of releases of oil andor hazardous material. y. massdep received an ira completion report, phase v remedy implementation plan (rip), and final inspection report dated march 18, 2003, which was prepared by stephen sakakeeny, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc. the,phase iv rip did not include a health and safety plan to be followed during the implementation of the comprehensive remedial action, and did not list the requisite building permits, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0874(3) (e) (f) respectively. z,, section 3.2 of the march 2003 rip, construction plans, engineering design and specifications, specified the dimension, size and capacity of treatment system components. the rip did not provide significant changes andor new information related to disposal site conditions, nor did the rip provide relevant design operational parameters, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0874 (3) (b) (2) (6). specifically, the rip omitted significant new information identified in the february 2003 characterization of product sample reports. in addition, the rip did not provide design calculations to determine the dimension, size and capacity of treatment system components expected treatment, destruction, immobilization or containment efficiencies and documentation of how that degree of effectiveness was determined. aa. question 6, of the august 26, 2008 massdep rfi, requested a chronological list of all instances where the treatment system was not operational for a period of seven consecutive days. the capaccio rfi response, dated september 29, 2008, listed 67 instances during the time period from january 19, 2005 through may 1, 2008, where the treatment system was not operational upon arrival of terrane remediation staff for the weekly maintenance visit due to various reasons. these aforementioned outages do not include an extended outage which purportedly occurred during a 48 day period from february 8, 2008 to march 27, 2008, reported in the remedy operating status (ros) inspection and monitoring report dated july 21, 2008, prepared by dawn horter, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc.in the matter of bodycote thermal processing, inc. acopce093a019 page 8 of 14 bb. with the exception of the ros inspection and monitoring report, dated july 21, 2008, ros inspection and monitoring reports, received by massdep reporting operational conditions since january 2005, characterized the bioremediation system as operating continuously, and failed to report the 67 instances during the time period from january 19, 2005 through may 1, 2008, where the treatment system was not operational upon arrival of terrane remediation staff for the weekly maintenance. respondents failure to report the system failures for more than 18 days on average without an outage over a 3.5 year period constitutes a failure to describe conditions or problems noted during the reporting period that are or may be affecting the performance of the remedial action, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0892(2)(c). cc. failure to provide hydraulic containment of remedial wastewater discharged upgradient of the point of withdrawal to ensure containment or recapture within the boundaries of the disposal site and to not exacerbate existing conditions or impair the performance of remedial actions, combined with operating the treatment system without obtaining a building permit and associated inspection from the city of worcester code inspection department, demonstrates that the performance standard for remedy r operating status has not been met. specifically, the remedial system has not been adequately designed in accordance with 310 cmr 40.0870 to achieve a permanent solution the remedial system has not been operated and maintained in accordance with applicable permits and approvals and, the source of oil andor hazardous material has not been controlled in accordance with 310 cmr 40.1003(5), in violation of 310 cmr 40.0893 (2) (b), (c), (d). , dd. the ros inspection and monitoring report, dated july 21, 2008, prepared by dawn horter, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc. noted an outage which occurred during a 48 day period from february 8, 2008 to march 27, 2008. the treatment system was not operational due to a frozen infiltration line. a review of the remedial system log provided within the capaccio rfi response, dated september 29, 2008, indicates the system status was identified as nonoperational during the treatment system inspection on february 15, 2008, and the system was successfully restarted during the treatment system inspection on april 10, 2008, indicating the system was inoperable for 62 days. written notice of a mechanical failure was not submitted to massdep within 30 days of obtaining such knowledge, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0893 (6) (b). ee. the failure to provide data and incorporate conclusions from the worldwide geosciences, inc. characterization of product sample reports, combined with characterizing the bioremediation system as operating continuously in ros inspection and monitoring reports since january 2005, constitutes making false, inaccurate, incomplete and misleading statements regarding the release and subsequent response actions at the disposal

e. respondent failed, in the phase iii rap, to identify and evaluate whether the selected remedial action alternative would eliminate, mitigate or control the gasoline release to chaffin pond, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0853. f. on august 31, 2007, respondent submitted a phase v remedy implementation plan (phase iv rip), which stated that the selected feasible remedial action alternative at the site is multiple injections of insitu chemical oxidation and groundwater monitoring. on may 30, 2008, respondent submitted a phase iv status report that detailed a single chemical oxidation injection event conducted at the site in february 2008. respondent then submitted a phase v completion statement on march 31, 2009. respondent failed to submit additional phase iv status reports every six months between may 30, 2008 and march 31, 2009, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0877. g. the phase iv completion statement stated no further phase iv chemical oxidation injection events are planned beyond the initial injection event even though the phase iv rip detailed multiple injection events. therefore, the respondent did not implement the selected remedial action alternative, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0864.in the matter of mass stickers plus, inc. acopce123a017 page 3 of 10 h. on march 31, 2009, respondent submitted a class c response action outcome (rao) statement, revised phase iii rap and phase iv completion report for rtn 214253. the rao states a temporary solution exists at the site. the rao indicates an uncontrolled source of gasoline contamination in the original 1983 gasoline ust release area remains and continues to migrate to, and impact surface water and sediments of chaffin pond. respondent failed to acknowledge the uncontrolled migration of gasoline to chaffin pond constitutes an uncontrolled source, which would preclude submission of a class c rao, in violation of 310 cmr 40.1003. i. inthe class c rao, respondent failed to acknowledge the uncontrolled migration of chaffin pond is a substantial hazard, as it is defined in 310 cmr 40.0956, which precludes submission of an rao and is a violation of 310 cmr 40.1050. j. chaffin pond is a tributary of wachusett reservoir, a public surface water supply. respondent failed to properly evaluate the risk to public welfare posed by the continuing release to a tributary of a public water supply in the method 3 risk characterization, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0994. k. in support of the class c rao, respondent states in the revised phase ii remedial action plan that a permanent solution is not feasible, but fails to provide sufficient justification for that conclusion or provide an initial screening of remedial action alternatives reasonably likely to be feasible, in violation of 310 cmr 40.1050. l. on may 19, 2009, respondent notified the department of the condition of substantial release migration (srm) condition posed by the uncontrolled migration of gasoline hydrocarbons to chaffin pond, and surface water concentrations in excess of massachusetts surface water standards from locations adjacent to the disposal site. respondent then failed to submit the required release notification form within 60 days, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0333. m. respondent is required and agreed to take measures to assess the srm as an immediate response action (ira) under . respondent failed to submit an ira plan within 60 days of notification of the condition of srm, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0420. respondent subsequently failed to meet the minimum requirements for ira assessment by failing to conduct periodic sampling and assessment of the release to chaffin pond, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0414 n. respondent failed to submit the first ira status reports within

allegations have led massdep to issue this consent order a. on august 24, 1989, massdep was notified by the worcester department of public health and code enforcement (dphce) that a release of petroleum impacted mill brook. worcester dphce identified the contamination as having originated from behind the subject property. massdep issued a notice of responsibility on the same day to mr. dennis smith of lindberg heat treating co. for the release of 250 gallons of quench oil. the release resulted from a holding tank overfill and impacted the parking lot, a storm drain, and mill brook. b. on july 23, 1991, massdep received correspondence from mr. dennis smith of lindberg heat treating co. notifying massdep of the detection of unspecified petroleum hydrocarbons in soil samples taken from the subject property. the sampling was conducted during the closure and abandonment of two fuel oil tanks beneath a building at the subject property. c, on august 19, 1998, massdep was notified by the worcester dphce that a release of petroleum impacted mill brook, and identified the contamination as having originated from behind the subject property. an oil fingerprint analysis confirmed the presence of 6 fuel oil in mill brook. massdep issued a notice of responsibility on september 29, 1998, to mr. martin lee of lindberg heat treating co. for the release of 6 fuel oil emanating from the lindberg property and impacting mill brook. d. on november 2, 1998, massdep received correspondence from mr. stephen sakakenny, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering on behalf of lindberg heat treating co. notifying massdep of the intent to evaluate evidence of oil contamination to determine if a notification condition exists pursuant to the mcp. on december 8, 1998, capaccio employed an oil fingerprint analysis of a grab sample from the mill brook culvert which identified 2 fuel oil as having emanated from the site. e, on march 15, 1999, massdep issued a notice of responsibility (nor) to mr. martin lee of lindberg heat treating co. for the release of oil to the soil andor groundwater at the subject property, and massdep assigned release tracking number 20012660 to the disposal site. the nor cited the july 23, 1991 correspondence identifying petroleum hydrocarbons in soils at the site, and the august 19, 1998 occurrence of 6 fuel oil in mill brook as evidence that a release of oil has occurred at the site and a condition of substantial release migration (srm) may be present. the nor required evaluation of notification conditions and, at a minimum, formal notification of a release of oil to the soil by april 15, 1999. b on march 19, 1999, mr. sakakenny verbally notified massdep that a release of 6 fuel oil to a storm drain occurred at the site as evidenced by oil having impacted the mill brook culvert. during the march 19, 1999 verbal notification mr. sakakenny stated that no srm condition was present as the opening to the culvert was plugged and oil wasin the matter of bodycote thermal processing, inc. acopce103a008 page 3 of 14 not presently entering the culvert. mr. sakakenny subsequently amended the notification on february 14, 2000, indicating 2 fuel oil as the released material and the presence of subsurface napl equal or greater than inch in at the site. subsequent capaccio environmental engineering status reports identified the source of contamination as an abandoned in place 3,000 gallon 2 fuel oil tank referred to in the aforementioned july 23, 1991 lindberg heat treating correspondence. g. respondent conducted response actions under beginning with an immediate response action (ira) on march 19, 1999, a biological degradation enhancing treatment system with integrated nonaqueous phase liquid (napl) recovery was proposed as an immediate response action on november 3, 2000. massdep issued a written approvalletter for the plan on december 21, 2000. further assessment activities included soil and groundwater sampling, and water table gauging. h. respondents comprehensive response action implemented to achieve a permanent solution at the disposal site consists of a napl recovery and insitu biological treatment system. groundwater is extracted from a recovery trench, napl separated from the groundwater in fractionating drums, and the groundwater is treated with nutrients prior to discharge in an onsite recharge trench. i. the groundwater treatment system removes napl from the extracted groundwater by fractionating the napl in three open drums connected in series which reside in a treatment shed. treatment system maintenance personnel remove napl floating in the fractionation drums by applying hydrophobic petroleum absorbent pads to the napl and collecting the petroleum saturated pads in a fivegallon pail. the napl and contaminated media are transported to a hazardous waste accumulation area in the fivegallon collection pail and handled with the facility hazardous waste stream in accordance with 310 cmr 30.0000. . j. on july 30, 2008, massdep conducted an audit inspection of response actions at the site. k. subsequent to the july 30, 2008 site inspection, massdep issued a request for information (rft), dated august 26, 2008. massdep received a rfi response, dated september 19, 2008, prepared by dawn horter, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc. l, at the time the audit inspection was conducted, several of the monitoring wells observed at the site were not secured with bolted roadbox caps, some monitoring wells were unserviceable with broken and exposed well screen, and some monitoring wells did not have a well plug installed. the following monitoring wells observed during the audit inspection were not maintained and secured to prevent the introduction of contaminants to the subsurface environment or the exacerbation of groundwater contamination, in violation of 310 cmr 40,0028 mw3, mw7, mw8, mw9, and mws4.in the matter of bodycote thermal processing, inc. acopce103a008 page 4 of 14 m., during the july 30, 2008 site inspection, massdep staff identified several violations of the management procedures for remediation waste at the site 1) the fivegallon remediation waste collection pail was not labeled in accordance with 310 cmr 40.0031(1) and 310 cmr 30.682. 2) the fivegallon remediation waste collection pail lacked a cover and contained remediation waste from previous napl removal events. the remediation waste container was not kept closed during storage of the remediation waste from previous events, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0031(1) and 310 cmr 30.685(1). 3) as the remediation waste container lacked a cover, the container could not be sealed prior to transfer to the accumulation area, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0031(1) and 310 cmr 30.685(1). 4) the remediation waste collection pail which contained remediation waste from previous napl removal events was stored in an accumulation area located in the treatment shed which was not posted with signage as required by 310 cmr 40.0031(1) and 40.0036(1), 310 cmr 30.341(4) and 30.253(6). 5) the remediation waste accumulation area located in the treatment shed was not clearly marked with fencing, gate or tape to clearly distinguish it from areas where wastes are not stored, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0031(1) and 40.0036(1), and 310 cmr 30.341(5). n. during the july 30, 2008 site inspection, massdep audit staff noted the onsite inspection log to be in poor condition and contained gaps in inspection and maintenance from february to july, 2008. the september 19, 2008 capaccio rfi response included inspection notes taken by an alternate site technician who logged the site visit information in an offsite log and omitted recording information in the onsite log from february to july 2008. failure to keep maintenance and inspection log books and records in the available secure onsite building is a violation of 310 cmr 40.0041(6)(d). o. the september 19, 2008 rfi response did not provide requested information documenting a final electrical inspection for the construction of the treatment shed and associated wiring for the groundwater treatment system. failure to obtain a building permit and associated inspection from the city of worcester code inspection department constitutes failure to construct and install such works in a manner adequate to protect health, safety, public welfare, and the environment, and in compliance with m.g.l. c. 21e and 310 cmr 40.0000 and is therefore a violation of 310 cmr 40.0041(5). p, question

the september 19, 2008 rfi response summary of all groundwater treatment system operational and field data failed to demonstrate that a certified operator had inspected the system at regular intervals of three months for the duration of the discharge, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0041(9). q. massdep received a supplemental rfi response, dated november 12, 2008, prepared by dawn horter, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc. the supplemental rfi response states that as of may 2001, capaccio staff determined 310 cmr 40,0041(9), which requires quarterly wwto inspections, was not applicable as the system meets the exemption outlined as being a discharge of remedial additives. the response states further that voluntary site inspection of the remedial system will be conducted by capaccio on a periodic basis, and the inspections were initiated during november 2008. subsequent to the audit inspection, massdep determined that the groundwater treatment system removing napl from the extracted groundwater prior to treatment with nutrients and discharge does not meet the aforementioned exemption. therefore, respondent was required to perform quarterly wwto inspections, and the failure to do so is in violation of 310 cmr 40,0041(9). r, massdep received a phase iii report, dated july 2002, which was prepared by stephen sakakeeny, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc. figures 4 and 5 of the phase iii depict a planar layout view of the groundwater extraction and recharge galleries, and a planar cross sectional view of the petroleum release conceptual model respectively. taken together, the figures show groundwater extraction and recharge occur downgradient of the source identified as an abandoned in place 3,000 gallon 2 fuel oil tank, located under the southern portion of the east end of the facility building. with the exception of one report, all groundwater contour maps included in remedy operation status reports, received by massdep since august 2004, depict groundwater mounding centered at the recharge gallery downgradient of the source. the groundwater mounding depicted in the groundwater contour maps show groundwater flow radially from the recharge area sufficient to effectively limit treatment and hydraulic containment to the contaminated area downgradient from the identified source and upgradient from the extraction gallery. s. the documented consistent gradient reversal at the east end of the source area demonstrates a negative impact on efforts to recover napl emanating from the source. the groundwater mound exhibits significant lateral gradient away from the extraction gallery indicating hydraulic containment of the groundwater at the disposal site is not maintained so that the remedial wastewater discharged upgradient of the point of withdrawal has not been contained or recaptured within the boundaries of the disposal site as required by 310 cmr 40.0045(4)(a). inducing a gradient away from thein the matter of bodycote thermal processing, inc. acopce103a008 page 6 of 14 extraction gallery initiated contaminant transport across the disposal site, thereby exacerbating site conditions and impairing the performance of the treatment system, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0045(4)(d) and as evidenced by napl migration to mw9, formerly upgradient of the source. t. dawn horter, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc. verbally notified massdep at 1240 p.m. on may 5, 2005, of the presence of greater than inch of subsurface napl in mw9 from a source other than the known abandoned 3,000 gallon 2 fuel oil tank. massdep received an ira plan dated july 7, 2005 prepared by dawn horter, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc. the ira plan referred to verbal notification from worldwide geosciences, inc. of houston, texas that a comparison of napl samples from mws4, mws7 and mw11 taken in 2002 with a napl sample from mw9 taken in 2005 indicated the 2002 and 2005 samples were unrelated. . u. copies of worldwide geosciences, inc. characterization of product sample reports, dated june 2005 and february 2003, respectively, were received by massdep on march 4, 2009. the february 2003 report characterized samples from the treatment system and two monitoring wells (mws7, mws11) as consistent with severely biodegraded residual fuel oils (5, 6) as the parent product. the sample from the other monitoring well (mws4) was characterized as consistent with a mixture of 2 grade fuel oil, and either an intermediate grade (4) or residual grade (5, 6) fuel oil. the report further states the level of biodegradation for all the four site samples indicates most probable exposure times of twenty years or more. v. the june 2005 worldwide geosciences report indicates a sample from mw9 was a severely biodegraded diesel2 fuel oil product with a probable exposure time of twenty years or more. in addition, the 2005 report states that if 2 grade fuel oil is a component of mws4 sample, the 2 fuel oil is a different 2 fuel oil than the 2 dieseifuel product associated with the current mw9 sample. the report further identifies the samples from the treatment system, mws7, and mws11 as consisting predominately of hydrocarbons that are heavier than the hydrogarbons associated with the mw9 sample (diesel2 fuel oil product). w. massdep has reviewed the june 2005 and february 2003 worldwide geosciences, inc. reports and has determined that the reports do not provide sufficient technical justification to demonstrate napl in mw9 has emanated from another source given the proximity to the identified source, gradient relative to the source, and the fact . that napl from mw9 has been characterized as the same type and weathered age as product specified for the abandoned 3,000 gallon 2 fuel oil tank. a the worldwide geosciences, inc. characterization of product sample reports, dated june 2005 and february 2003, indicate the existence of contaminant sources other than the identified 3,000 gallon 2 fuel oil tank. the june 2005 report characterizes thein the matter of bodycote thermal processing, inc. acopce103a008 page 7 of 14 treatment system napl sample as consisting predominately of hydrocarbons other than diesel range organics, thereby demonstrating the product recovered by the treatment system since october 2002 has predominantly consisted of a petroleum product other than 2 fuel oil. the conclusions presented in the characterization of product sample reports were of such import that it was necessary to provide additional information to the phase ii report, dated may 24, 2002, prepared by stephen sakakeeny, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc., as required by 310 cmr 40.0835(4), to adequately characterize the disposal site consistent with the response action performance standard described in 310 cmr 40,0191. respondents failure to provide the additional information to the phase ii report is a violation of 310 cmr 40,0835(4). in addition, the may 24, 2002 phase ii report fails to comply with the performance standards for a phase ii report required by 310 cmr 40.0833 (1)(a), by failing to adequately develop and evaluate sufficient information to support conclusions and opinions regarding the source, nature, extent, and potential impacts of releases of oil andor hazardous material. y. massdep received an ira completion report, phase v remedy implementation plan (rip), and final inspection report dated march 18, 2003, which was prepared by stephen sakakeeny, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc. the phase iv rip did not include a health and safety plan to be followed during the implementation of the comprehensive remedial action, and did not list the requisite building permits, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0874(3) (e) (f) respectively. ly section 3.2 of the march 2003 rip, construction plans, engineering design and specifications, specified the dimension, size and capacity of treatment system components. the rip did not provide significant changes andor new information related to disposal site conditions, nor did the rip provide relevant design operational parameters, in violation of 310 cmr 40,0874 (3) (b) (2) (6). specifically, the rip omitted significant new information identified in the february 2003 characterization of product sample reports. in addition, the rip did not provide design calculations to determine the dimension, size and capacity of treatment system components expected treatment, destruction, immobilization or containment efficiencies and documentation of how that degree of effectiveness was determined. aa. question 6, of the august 26, 2008 massdep rfi, requested a chronological list of all instances where the treatment system was not operational for a period of seven consecutive days. the capaccio rfi response, dated september 29, 2008, listed 67 instances during the time period from january 19, 2005 through may 1, 2008, where the treatment system was not operational upon arrival of terrane remediation staff for the weekly maintenance visit due to various reasons, these aforementioned outages do not include an extended outage which purportedly occurred during a 48 day period from february 8, 2008 to march 27, 2008, reported in the remedy operating status (ros) inspection and monitoring report dated july 21, 2008, prepared by dawn horter, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc.in the matter of bodycote thermal processing, inc. acopce103a008 page 8 of 14 bb. with the exception of the ros inspection and monitoring report, dated july 21, 2008, ros inspection and monitoring reports, received by massdep reporting operational conditions since january 2005, characterized the bioremediation system as operating continuously, and failed to report the 67 instances during the time period from january 19, 2005 through may 1, 2008, where the treatment system was not operational upon arrival of terrane remediation staff for the weekly maintenance. respondents failure to report the system failures for more than 18 days on average without an outage over a 3.5 year period constitutes a failure to describe conditions or problems noted during the reporting period that are or may be affecting the performance of the remedial action, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0892(2)(c). cc. failure to provide hydraulic containment of remedial wastewater discharged upgradient of the point of withdrawal to ensure containment or recapture within the boundaries of the disposal site and to not exacerbate existing conditions or impair the performance of remedial actions, combined with operating the treatment system without obtaining a building permit and associated inspection from the city of worcester code inspection department, demonstrates that the performance standard for remedy operating status has not been met. specifically, the remedial system has not been adequately designed in accordance with 310 cmr 40.0870 to achieve a permanent solution the remedial system has not been operated and maintained in accordance with applicable permits and approvals and, the source of oil andor hazardous material has not been controlled in accordance with 310 cmr 40.1003(5), in violation of 310 cmr 40.0893 (2) (b), (c), (d). dd. the ros inspection and monitoring report, dated july 21, 2008, prepared by dawn horter, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc. noted an outage which occurred during a 48 day period from february 8, 2008 to march 27, 2008. the treatment system was not operational due to a frozen infiltration line. a review of the remedial system log provided within the capaccio rfi response, dated september 29, 2008, indicates the system status was identified as nonoperational during the treatment system inspection on february 15, 2008, and the system was successfully restarted during the treatment system inspection on april 10, 2008, indicating the system was inoperable for 62 days. written notice of a mechanical failure was not submitted to massdep within 30 days of obtaining such knowledge, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0893 (6)

following facts and allegations have led massdep to issue this consent order a, on august 24, 1989, massdep was notified by the worcester department of public health and code enforcement (dphce) that a release of petroleum impacted mill brook. worcester dphce identified the contamination as having originated from behind the subject property. massdep issued a notice of responsibility on the same day to mr. dennis smith of lindberg heat treating co. for the release of 250 gallons of quench oil. the release resulted from a holding tank overfill and impacted the parking lot, a storm drain, and mill brook. b. on july 23, 1991, massdep received correspondence from mr. dennis smith of lindberg heat treating co. notifying massdep of the detection of unspecified petroleum hydrocarbons in soil samples taken from the subject property. the sampling was conducted during the closure and abandonment of two fuel oil tanks beneath a building at the subject property. ce on august 19, 1998, massdep was notified by the worcester dphce that a release of petroleum impacted mill brook, and identified the contamination as having originated from behind the subject property. an oil fingerprint analysis confirmed the presence of 6 fuel oil in mill brook. massdep issued a notice of responsibility on september 29, 1998, to mr. martin lee of lindberg heat treating co. for the release of 6 fuel oil emanating from the lindberg property and impacting mill brook. d. on november 2, 1998, massdep received correspondence from mr. stephen sakakenny, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering on behalf of lindberg heat treating co. notifying massdep of the intent to evaluate evidence of oil contamination to determine if a notification condition exists pursuant to the mcp. on december 8, 1998, capaccio employed an oil fingerprint analysis of a grab sample from the mill brook culvert which identified 2 fuel oil as having emanated from the site. e. on march 15, 1999, massdep issued a notice of responsibility (nor) to mr. martin lee of lindberg heat treating co. for the release of oil to the soil andor groundwater at the subject property, and massdep assigned release tracking number 20012660 to the disposal site. the nor cited the july 23, 1991 correspondence identifying petroleum hydrocarbons in soils at the site, and the august 19, 1998 occurrence of 6 fuel oil in mill brook as evidence that a release of oil has occurred at the site and a condition of substantial release migration (srm) may be present. the nor required evaluation of notification conditions and, at a minimum, formal notification of a release of oil to the soil by april 15, 1999. f. on march 19, 1999, mr. sakakenny verbally notified massdep that a release of 6 fuel oil to a storm drain occurred at the site as evidenced by oil having impacted the mill brook culvert. during the march 19, 1999 verbal notification mr. sakakenny stated that no srm condition was present as the opening to the culvert was plugged and oil wasin the matter of bodycote thermal processing, inc. acopce103a008 page 3 of 14 not presently entering the culvert. mr. sakakenny subsequently amended the notification on february 14, 2000, indicating 2 fuel oil as the released material and the presence of subsurface napl equal or greater than inch in at the site. subsequent capaccio environmental engineering status reports identified the source of contamination as an abandoned in place 3,000 gallon 2 fuel oil tank referred to in the aforementioned july 23, 1991 lindberg heat treating correspondence. g. respondent conducted response actions under beginning with an immediate response action (ira) on march 19, 1999. a biological degradation enhancing treatment system with integrated nonaqueous phase liquid (napl) recovery was proposed as an immediate response action on november 3, 2000. massdep issued a written approval letter for the plan on december 21, 2000. further assessment activities included soil and groundwater sampling, and water table gauging. h. respondents comprehensive response action implemented to achieve a permanent solution at the disposal site consists of a napl recovery and insitu biological treatment system. groundwater is extracted from a recovery trench, napl separated from the groundwater in fractionating drums, and the groundwater is treated with nutrients prior to discharge in an onsite recharge trench. i, the groundwater treatment system removes napl from the extracted groundwater by fractionating the napl in three open drums connected in series which reside in a treatment shed. treatment system maintenance personnel remove napl floating in the fractionation drums by applying hydrophobic petroleum absorbent pads to the napl and collecting the petroleum saturated pads in a fivegallon pail. the napl and contaminated media are transported to a hazardous waste accumulation area in the fivegallon collection pail and handled with the facility hazardous waste stream in accordance with 310 cmr 30.0000. j. on july 30, 2008, massdep conducted an audit inspection of response actions at the site. k. subsequent to the july 30, 2008 site inspection, massdep issued a request for information (rfi), dated august 26, 2008. massdep received a rfi response, dated september 19, 2008, prepared by dawn horter, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc. l, at the time the audit inspection was conducted, several of the monitoring wells observed at the site were not secured with bolted roadbox caps, some monitoring wells were unserviceable with broken and exposed well screen, and some monitoring wells did not have a weil plug installed. the following monitoring wells observed during the audit inspection were not maintained and secured to prevent the introduction of contaminants to the subsurface environment or the exacerbation of groundwater contamination, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0028 mw3, mw7, mw8, mw9, and mws4,in the matter of bodycote thermal processing, inc. acopce103a008 page 4 of 14 m. during the july 30, 2008 site inspection, massdep staff identified several violations of the management procedures for remediation waste at the site 1) the fivegallon remediation waste collection pail was not labeled in accordance with 310 cmr 40.0031(1) and 310 cmr 30.682. 2) the fivegallon remediation waste collection pail lacked a cover and contained remediation waste from previous napl removal events. the remediation waste container was not kept closed during storage of the remediation waste from previous events, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0031(1) and 310 cmr 30.685(1). 3) as the remediation waste container lacked a cover, the container could not be sealed prior to transfer to the accumulation area, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0031(1) and 310 cmr 30.685(1). 4) the remediation waste collection pail which contained remediation waste from previous napl removal events was stored in an accumulation area located in the treatment shed which was not posted with signage as required by 310 cmr 40,0031(1) and 40.0036(1), 310 cmr 30.341(4) and 30.253(6). 5) the remediation waste accumulation area located in the treatment shed was not clearly marked with fencing, gate or tape to clearly distinguish it from areas where wastes are not stored, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0031(1) and 40.0036(1), and 310 cmr 30.341(5). n. during the july 30, 2008 site inspection, massdep audit staff noted the onsite inspection log to be in poor condition and contained gaps in inspection and maintenance from february to july, 2008. the september 19, 2008 capaccio rfi response included inspection notes taken by an alternate site technician who logged the site visit information in an offsite log and omitted recording information in the onsite log from february to july 2008. failure to keep maintenance and inspection log books and records in the available secure onsite building is a violation of 310 cmr 40,0041(6)(d). o. the september 19, 2008 rfi response did not provide requested information documenting a final electrical inspection for the construction of the treatment shed and associated wiring for the groundwater treatment system. failure to obtain a building permit and associated inspection from the city of worcester code inspection department constitutes failure to construct and install such works in a manner adequate to protect health, safety, public welfare, and the environment, and in compliance with m.g.l. c. 21e and 310 cmr 40,0000 and is therefore a violation of 310 cmr 40.0041(5). b. question one of the massdep august 26, 2008 rfi requested the names of individuals who had been performing onsite monitoring activities, and question sevenin the matter of bodycote thermal processing, inc. acopce103a008 page 5 of 14 requested the names of the licensed wastewater treatment operators (wwto) from august 2004 to the present. the september 19, 2008 capaccio rfi response reports terrane remediation, inc. as the sole operator performing onsite monitoring during the subject time period and two licensed wwtos for the subject period mark racicot, p.e. and wayne bates, p.h.d. a review of the september 19, 2008 rfi response summary of all groundwater treatment system operational and field data failed to demonstrate that a certified operator had inspected the system at regular intervals of three months for the duration of the discharge, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0041(9). q. massdep received a supplemental rfi response, dated november 12, 2008, prepared by dawn horter, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc. the supplemental rfi response states that as of may 2001, capaccio staff determined 310 cmr 40,.0041(9), which requires quarterly wwto inspections, was not applicable as the system meets the exemption outlined as being a discharge of remedial additives. the response states further that voluntary site inspection of the remedial system will be conducted by capaccio on a periodic basis, and the inspections were initiated during november 2008. subsequent to the audit inspection, massdep determined that the groundwater treatment system removing napl from the extracted groundwater prior to treatment with nutrients and discharge does not meet the aforementioned exemption. therefore, respondent was required to perform quarterly wwto inspections, and the failure to do so is in violation of 310 cmr 40.0041(9), r. massdep received a phase iii report, dated july 2002, which was prepared by stephen sakakeeny, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc. figures 4 and 5 of the phase iii depict a planar layout view of the groundwater extraction and recharge galleries, and a planar cross sectional view of the petroleum release conceptual model respectively. taken together, the figures show groundwater extraction and recharge occur downgradient of the source identified as an abandoned in place 3,000 gallon 2 fuel oil tank, located under the southern portion of the east end of the facility building. with the exception of one report, all groundwater contour maps included in remedy operation status reports, received by massdep since august 2004, depict groundwater mounding centered at the recharge gallery downgradient of the source. the groundwater mounding depicted in the groundwater contour maps show groundwater flow radially from the recharge area sufficient to effectively limit treatment and hydraulic containment to the contaminated area downgradient from the identified source and upgradient from the extraction gallery. s. the documented consistent gradient reversal at the east end of the source area demonstrates a negative impact on efforts to recover napl emanating from the source. the groundwater mound exhibits significant lateral gradient away from the extraction gallery indicating hydraulic containment of the groundwater at the disposal site is not maintained so that the remedial wastewater discharged upgradient of the point of withdrawal has not been contained or recaptured within the boundaries of the disposal site as required by 310 cmr 40.0045(4)(a). inducing a gradient away from thein the matter of bodycote thermal processing, inc. acopce103a008 page 6 of 14 extraction gallery initiated contaminant transport across the disposal site, thereby exacerbating site conditions and impairing the performance of the treatment system, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0045(4)(d) and as evidenced by napl migration to mw9, formerly upgradient of the source, ta dawn horter, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc. verbally notified massdep at 1240 p.m. on may 5, 2005, of the presence of greater than 2 inch of subsurface napl in mw9 from a source other than the known abandoned 3,000 gallon 2 fuel oil tank. massdep received an ira plan dated july 7, 2005 prepared by dawn horter, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc. the ira plan referred to verbal notification from worldwide geosciences, inc, of houston, texas that a comparison of napl samples from mws4, mws7 and mw11 taken in 2002 with a napl sample from mw9 taken in 2005 indicated the 2002 and 2005 samples were unrelated. u. copies of worldwide geosciences, inc. characterization of product sample reports, dated june 2005 and february 2003, respectively, were received by massdep on march 4, 2009, the february 2003 report characterized samples from the treatment system and two monitoring wells (mws7, mws11) as consistent with severely biodegraded residual fuel oils (5, 6) as the parent product. the sample from the other monitoring well (mws4) was characterized as consistent with a mixture of 2 grade fuel oil, and either an intermediate grade (4) or residual grade (5, 6) fuel oil. the report further states the level of biodegradation for all the four site samples indicates most probable exposure times of twenty years or more. v. the june 2005 worldwide geosciences report indicates a sample from mw9 was a severely biodegraded diesel2 fuel oil product with a probable exposure time of twenty years or more. in addition, the 2005 report states that if 2 grade fuel oil is a component of mws4 sample, the 2 fuel oil is a different 2 fuel oil than the 2 dieselfuel product associated with the current mw9 sample. the report further identifies the samples from the treatment system, mws7, and mws11 as consisting predominately of hydrocarbons that are heavier than the hydrocarbons associated with the mw9 sample (diesel2 fuel oil product). w. massdep has reviewed the june 2005 and february 2003 worldwide geosciences, inc. reports and has determined that the reports do not provide sufficient technical justification to demonstrate napl in mw9 has emanated from another source given the proximity to the identified source, gradient relative to the source, and the fact . that napl from mw9 has been characterized as the same type and weathered age as product specified for the abandoned 3,000 gallon 2 fuel oil tank. x. the worldwide geosciences, inc. characterization of product sample reports, dated june 2005 and february 2003, indicate the existence of contaminant sources other than the identified 3,000 gallon 2 fuel oil tank. the june 2005 report characterizes thein the matter of bodycote thermal processing, inc. acopce103a008 page 7 of 14 treatment system napl sample as consisting predominately of hydrocarbons other than diesel range organics, thereby demonstrating the product recovered by the treatment system since october 2002 has predominantly consisted of a petroleum product other than 2 fuel oil. the conclusions presented in the characterization of product sample reports were of such import that it was necessary to provide additional information to the phase ii report, dated may 24, 2002, prepared by stephen sakakeeny, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc., as required by 310 cmr 40.0835(4), to adequately characterize the disposal site consistent with the response action performance standard described in 310 cmr 40.0191. respondents failure to provide the additional information to the phase ii report is a violation of 310 cmr 40.0835(4). in addition, the may 24, 2002 phase ii report fails to comply with the performance standards for a phase ii report required by 310 cmr 40.0833 (1)a), by failing to adequately develop and evaluate sufficient information to support conclusions and opinions regarding the source, nature, extent, and potential impacts of releases of oil andor hazardous material. y. massdep received an ira completion report, phase v remedy implementation plan (rip), and final inspection report dated march 18, 2003, which was prepared by stephen sakakeeny, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc. the phase iv rip did not include a health and safety plan to be followed during the implementation of the comprehensive remedial action, and did not list the requisite building permits, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0874(3) (e) (f respectively. z. section 3.2 of the march 2003 rip, construction plans, engineering design and specifications, specified the dimension, size and capacity of treatment system components. the rip did not provide significant changes andor new information related to disposal site conditions, nor did the rip provide relevant design operational parameters, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0874 (3) (b) (2) (6). specifically, the rip omitted significant new information identified in the february 2003 characterization of product sample reports. in addition, the rip did not provide design calculations to determine the dimension, size and capacity of treatment system components expected treatment, destruction, immobilization or containment efficiencies and documentation of how that degree of effectiveness was determined. aa. question 6, of the august 26, 2008 massdep rfi, requested a chronological list of all instances where the treatment system was not operational for a period of seven consecutive days. the capaccio rfi response, dated september 29, 2008, listed 67 instances during the time period from january 19, 2005 through may 1, 2008, where the treatment system was not operational upon arrival of terrane remediation staff for the weekly maintenance visit due to various reasons. these aforementioned outages do not include an extended outage which purportedly occurred during a 48 day period from february 8, 2008 to march 27, 2008, reported in the remedy operating status (ros) inspection and monitoring report dated july 21, 2008, prepared by dawn horter, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc.in the matter of bodycote thermal processing, inc. acopce103a008 page 8 of 14 bb. with the exception of the ros inspection and monitoring report, dated july 21, 2008, ros inspection and monitoring reports, received by massdep reporting operational conditions since january 2005, characterized the bioremediation system as operating continuously, and failed to report the 67 instances during the time period from january 19, 2005 through may 1, 2008, where the treatment system was not operational upon arrival of terrane remediation staff for the weekly maintenance. respondents failure to report the system failures for more than 18 days on average without an outage over a 3.5 year period constitutes a failure to describe conditions or problems noted during the reporting period that are or may be affecting the performance of the remedial action, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0892(2)(c). cc. failure to provide hydraulic containment of remedial wastewater discharged upgradient of the point of withdrawal to ensure containment or recapture within the boundaries of the disposal site and to not exacerbate existing conditions or impair the performance of remedial actions, combined with operating the treatment system without obtaining a building permit and associated inspection from the city of worcester code inspection department, demonstrates that the performance standard for remedy operating status has not been met. specifically, the remedial system has not been adequately designed in accordance with 310 cmr 40.0870 to achieve a permanent solution the remedial system has not been operated and maintained in accordance with applicable permits and approvals and, the source of oil andor hazardous material has not been controlled in accordance with 310 cmr 40.1003(5), in violation of 310 cmr 40.0893 (2) (b), (c), (d). dd. the ros inspection and monitoring report, dated july 21, 2008, prepared by dawn horter, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc. noted an outage which occurred during a 48 day period from february 8, 2008 to march 27, 2008. the treatment system was not operational due to a frozen infiltration line. a review of the remedial system log provided within the capaccio rfi response, dated september 29, 2008, indicates the system status was identified as nonoperational during the treatment system inspection on february 15, 2008, and the system was successfully restarted during the treatment system inspection on april 10, 2008, indicating the system was inoperable

1,4dichlorobenzene (1,4dcb) in the public drinking water supply well serving the property at concentrations exceeding the applicable reporting concentrations (rcgw1). release tracking number (rtn) 20012059 was assigned to the site. assessment at the site identified a former drywell as the source of 14dcb and other chlorinated solvents in groundwater. as part of an immediate response action (ira), several residential drinking water wells proximate to the site were sampled for volatile organic compound (voc) analysis in february 1998. samples collected from private wells located at 421 and 434 west main street contained detectable concentrations of chlorinated vocs that were below rcgw1. b. in january 1999, a drinking water sample was collected from the 434 west main street residential well. analytical results indicated that the concentration of 1,4dcb exceeded rcgw1. was assigned to this release condition. in response to this data, respondent conducted a second ira

west main street potable well, and one round of groundwater sampling was completed in bedrock monitoring wells gz1 and gz2. this limited data set was not sufficient to establish groundwater contaminant trends influenced by seasonal variations (precipitation events, droughts) and varying seasonal well pumping rates. therefore, the conclusion that site conditions were stable was not supported as required to complete ira actions in accordance with 310 cmr 40.0427. also, the limited data set collected at 421 w. main street was insufficient to determine the degree of hazard to human health from exposure to site contaminants as required by 310 cmr 40.0414(a). further ira actions (assessment andor mitigation) were required to verify or ensure that concentrations of contaminants detected in drinking water at 421 west main street were stable and consistently below rcgw1. failure to perform an ira in accordance with mcp provisions is a violation of 310 cmr 40.0420(2). d. in february 2002, four years after the detection of site contaminants in the residential well, a second drinking water sample was collected from the 421 west main street residence. chlorobenzene, cis1,2dichlorethene and 1,2dichlorobenzene were detected at concentrations less than rcgw1. two years later, in march 2004 another sample was collected from 421 west main street, which also contained

consent order a. on june 30, 1998, respondent notified massdep of cavaline constituents in . groundwater at concentrations that exceeded applicable reportable concentrations (regw1) within 500 feet of drinking water supply wells. this condition was assigned . respondent was required to notify massdep immediately and no later than 72hours from obtaining knowledge of thisfile no. acopce063a022 2 condition. a review of historical groundwater data reveals that contaminants. exceeded rcgw1 in samples collected in april 1997, september 1997 and. february 1998. therefore, the 72hour reporting condition was first reported to massdep more than a year after respondent obtained the initial data exceeding rcgw1, in violation of 310 cmr 40,0313(3). . in october 1998, respondent sampled private water supply wells within 500 feet of the site as an immediate response action (ira). on january 14, 1999, respondent submitted an ira completion statement (irac) that stated on the basis of the lack of detection of gasoline constituents in either the onsite or offsite water supply wells and given the age of the gasoline release, we conclude that the site (sic)does not pose a short term risk to area water supplies. therefore, in our opinion, additional immediate response actions are not warranted. the irac included the laboratory analytical reports for drinking water sampled in october 1998. the analytical reports document the detection of methyl tertiarybutylether (mtbe) in two of the private water supply wells located between 550 feet and 725 feet west of the property at 195 city depot road, contradicting the conclusory statement in the irac. therefore, respondent provided false, inaccurate, and misleading statements to massdep, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0022(2). . on june 24, 2004, the charlton board of health informed massdep that mtbe had been detected in a newly isistalled private drinking water supply well at 164 city depot road, located approximately 1,600 feet southwest of the site. massdep contacted respondent.and requested that they resample this private well. on august 9, 2004, after respondent resampled the well and confirmed the presence of mtbe, massdep requested that respondent provide notification within 72 hours for a condition of substantial release migration (srm) as defined at 310 cmr 40.0006, respondent did not notify massdep until august 18,.2004, nine days after confirming the detection of mtbe within a private drinking water well. therefore, respondent failed to notify massdep within 72 hours of obtaining knowledge of the condition of srm, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0313(5). massdep assigned release tracking number (rtn) 20015375 to the condition of srm in august 2004. from october 1998 through august 2004, respondent failed to conduct an ira in sresponse to the srm, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0412(3). typical ira requirements would have included providing bottled water or treatment systems to affected residents and quarterly sampling of private water supply wells. e. the jra for the condition of srm required sampling of the seven private water supply wells that were within 500 feet of the site in september 2004. followingfile no. acopce063a022 3 detection of mtbe in some of the private wells, an additional 500foot radius was established from those locations where mtbe was detected, and an additional seven private water supply wells were sampled in october and november 2004. in total, mtbe was detected in fifteen of the sixteen sampling locations at concentrations ranging from 0.8 ppb to 9.3 ppb. the presence of contamination in residential drinking water supply wells constitutes a critical exposure pathway (cep) as defined at 310 cmr 40.0006. respondent conducting an ira are required to eliminate or mitigate ceps where feasible. in this instance, the cep could have been mitigated through the provision of bottled water or point of entry treatment systems. respondent did not eliminate or mitigate the cep during the ira, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0414(4). respondent submitted an irac for on december 22, 2004, stating that mtbe contamination was ubiquitous in the bedrock and that the site was not the source of mtbe in private wells. however, a review of the file by massdep indicates that mtbe was released at the site, and that the source area remediation was incomplete. in 1995 a gasoline underground storage tank, and the associated piping and pump island were removed. laboratory analyses of postexcavation soil samples collected in 1995 detected concentrations of mtbe up to 153 parts per million (ppm), exceeding the applicable method 1 risk characterization standard of 0.3 ppm mtbe for soil in drinking water areas. furthermore, because depth to the bedrock surface is approximately eight (8) feet below grade in the ust area, migration of mtbe into the bedrock aquifer would have been likely. j the conclusion of the 2004 irac for was not based upon assessment of the bedrock aquifer such as bedrock monitoring well installation, bedrock surface mapping, fracture analysis, borehole survey, or pump tests to evaluate hydrogeologic connectivity to the surficial aquifer, private wells, or surface water potentially impacted by road runoff, as detailed in massdep guidance document standard reference for monitoring wells, wsc31091. furthermore, sampling of private wells from similar hydrogeologic settings were not obtained to provide statistical analyses to demonstrate a ubiquitous condition of mtbe impacts in areas not potentially effected by a historic gasoline release. respondent submitted a phase il comprehensive site assessment report (phase ii report) to massdep on march 28, 2001. concentrations of mtbe were first detected in private drinking water supply wells in october 1998, as previously described. this data was not incorporated into the phase ii report and assessment of the bedrock aquifer was not conducted to determine the extent of mtbe contamination. consequently, private wells were not evaluated as exposure points in the risk characterization included in the phase ii report. failure to define the horizontal and vertical extent of contamination is a violation of 310 cmr. 40.0835(4)(f).file no. acopce063a022 4 g. respondent submitted a phase iv asbuilt construction report and final inspection report on may 31, 2002, stating that magnesium hydroxide was applied to the subsurface during comprehensive response actions. the potable water supply well at 195 city depot road is located approximately 70 feet from the treatment area. written approval from massdep was required prior to application of remedial additives within 100 feet of a private well. this written approval was not requested or obtained by respondent, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0046(3). h. as previously described, remedial additives were applied to the subsurface in october 2001. quarterly groundwater monitoring after application of remedial additives is required. initial post remediation groundwater monitoring was conducted on march 14, 2002, approximately five months after final application of remedial additives, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0046(4)(b). 5. the parties have agreed to enter into this consent order because they agree that it is in their own interests, and in the public interest, to proceed promptly with the

a, through its licensed site professional, respondent made the following submittals described in this fact section below. respondent submitted a remedy operation status (ros) opinion on november 16, 2006 for the petroleum release at the site. among other things, the ros opinion failed to comply with the requirements of the mcp in the following respects, first, respondent had not delineated the downgradient extent of the release, and consequently had not adequately evaluated the potential for indoor air impacts at downgradient residences. second, the ros opinion did not include a substantial hazard evaluation. third, the selected remedy, monitored natural attenuation (mna), was not demonstrated to be appropriate andor effective at the site, and the plan for conducting mna did not conform to massdep, astm, or usepa guidance for the implementation of mna. b. massdep conducted an audit of the ros response actions, and on may 3, 2007 issued a (non) to respondent, citing violations including failing to employ the response action performance standard (raps) 310 cmr 40.0191(2), failure to meet the performance standards for phase iv 310 cmr 40.0872(1) and ros 310 cmr 40.0893(2), and failure to include a health and safety plan in the remedy implementation plan 310 cmr 40.0874(3)(e). the non required respondent to either submit a revised ros opinion meeting the requirements of the mcp, or retract the ros opinion and contact massdep to arrange an enforcement conference. c, in response to the non, on june 25, 2007, respondent submitted a proposal, which was subsequently approved by massdep, to retract the ros opinion and submit a response action outcome statement (rao) by july 25, 2007. subsequently, respondent requested, and massdep approved a further extension of this deadline to september 4, 2007. d. on august 20, 2007, respondent conducted a soil gas survey along the hydrogeologically downgradient sidewalks of lincoln street, adjacent to residences. photoionization detector readings from the soil gas points were elevated, ranging up to 767 parts per million. one soil gas sample was submitted for laboratory analysis, and it was found to contain high concentrations of airphase petroleum hydrocarbons (aph) including 212,000 micrograms per cubic meter (ugm3) c5c8 aliphatics, and 437,000 ugm3 c9c12 aliphatics. the laboratory report containing these data is dated august 28, 2007. based on this information, respondent concluded that a potential imminent hazard existed for downgradient residences. ei on august 31, 2007, respondent notified massdep of the potential imminent hazard. massdep assigned to this condition and approved an immediate response action (ira) including additional soil gas sampling and indoor air sampling at downgradient residences. respondent sampled indoor air at residences at 316 lincoln street on september 13, 2007, and at 310 lincoln street on october 3, 2007, laboratory reports from both residences, dated september 21 and october 10, 2007, contained elevated aph in similar relative proportions as those detected in soil gas.in the matter of lincoln mechanic realty trust acopce093a028 page 3 of 9

states that ros would be terminated, but failed to indicate this fact on the required bwsc108 form and lsp opinion. g. in february and may 2008, during the course of the ira, respondent conducted soil and groundwater sampling and fingerprinting. from those soil and groundwater results, respondent concluded that there is a separate source of soil and groundwater contamination at 316 lincoln. street, which is dissimilar to the petroleum detected at the site. respondent further concludes that the separate source is the cause of indoor air contamination at that address. massdep has issued to that

massdep received a complaint of a release of gasoline to chaffin pond, a tributary of wachusett reservoir. the release was attributed to failure of ain the matter of mass stickers plus, inc. acopce123a017 page 2 of 10 6,000gallon gasoline underground storage tank (ust) at jacks getty, 525 main street, holden. response actions conducted at the time included removal of the ust and installation of a gasoline recovery system. b. on april 1, 2002, the former owner, mr. james mandel submitted a release notification form (rnf) for a release of gasoline hydrocarbons in soil and

chemical oxidation and monitoring as the remedial action alternative likely to achieve a permanent solution. respondent utilized limited surface water quality data from chaffin pond in preparation of the phase ii report. additionally, respondent failed to provide a complete evaluation of the horizontal and vertical extent of contamination in all media, and specifically did not include soil vapor, indoor air or sediment data from chaffin pond in the phase ii. thereby, respondent failed to adequately characterize risk at the disposal site in the phase ii report, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0904. e. respondent failed, in the phase iii rap, to identify and evaluate whether the selected remedial action alternative would eliminate, mitigate or control the gasoline release to chaffin pond, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0853. f. on august 31, 2007, respondent submitted a phase v remedy implementation plan (phase iv rip), which stated that the selected feasible remedial action alternative at the site is multiple injections of insitu chemical oxidation and groundwater monitoring. on may 30, 2008, respondent submitted a phase iv status report that detailed a single chemical oxidation injection event conducted at the site in february 2008. respondent then submitted a phase v completion statement on march 31, 2009. respondent failed to submit additional phase iv status reports every

gasoline ust release area remains and continues to migrate to, and impact surface water and sediments of chaffin pond. respondent failed to acknowledge the uncontrolled migration of gasoline to chaffin pond constitutes an uncontrolled source, which would preclude submission of a class c rao, in violation of 310 cmr 40.1003. i. inthe class c rao, respondent failed to acknowledge the uncontrolled migration of chaffin pond is a substantial hazard, as it is defined in 310 cmr 40.0956, which precludes submission of an rao and is a violation of 310 cmr 40.1050. j. chaffin pond is a tributary of wachusett reservoir, a public surface water supply. respondent failed to properly evaluate the risk to public welfare posed by the continuing release to a tributary of a public water supply in the method 3 risk characterization, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0994. k. in support of the class c rao, respondent states in the revised phase ii remedial action plan that a permanent solution is not feasible, but fails to provide sufficient justification for that conclusion or provide an initial screening of remedial action alternatives reasonably likely to be feasible, in

(2) immediate response actions shall be conducted in compliance with all applicable provisions and time lines specified in 310 cmr 40.0400, and in compliance with any response action requirements deemed necessary by the department andor specified by the department in its approval of immediate response action plans. fact on march 6, 1997, the department was notified of the presence of three inches of napl in a monitoring well at the site, and assigned release tracking 2001 1634 to this condition. the department orally approved an immediate response action (ira) to include weekly gauging and bailing of the napl. on april 3, 1997, the department received notification of an imminent hazard condition at the site, specifically, that polychlorinated biphenyls (pcbs) were present at up to 7,816 parts per million (ppm) in accessible surficial soil at the site. the department assigned release tracking 20011667 to this condition and approved an ira to include fencing the area and further assessment to delineate the extent of the imminent hazard conditions. an ira plan was submitted for both 2001 1634 and 20011667 on may 12, 1997, which restated that the prp intended to conduct these actions. an ira status report was submitted on july 14, 1997, the second status report was submitted late on march 12, 1998, and the subsequent six ira status reports required through 2001 were not submitted. on august 4, 1998, the department received a letter from the lsp of record, stating that he was no longer retained by the prp to conduct the required iras.acopce053a012. 4 on may 1, 1999, the department conducted a site inspection and found that the fence had not been maintained and that the imminent hazard concentrations of pcb in soil were readily accessible. the department issued a notice of response action (nora) to the prp, requiring that he correct the violation or the department would take statefunded actions and seek cost recovery. the prp submitted a letter stating that he had retained a fencing company to repair the fence. the department issued a to the prp for violations, including failure to submit ira status reports, on april 27,2001. asa result, the prp again retained a consultant and began submitting ira status reports on july 20, 2001. on february 20, 2002, the department conducted an audit inspection and observed 3.5 feet of napl in a monitoring well at the site. in subsequent ira status reports, the consultant acknowledged that napl had not been bailed between the stoppage of work in august 1998 and the audit inspection in 2002. on june 17, 2002, the department was notified of imminent hazard concentrations of pcb in surficial soi in a different area (the southern end) of the site. the department assigned release tracking 20014355 and approved a third ira, including the following requirements post signs and install chain link fencing around impacted area conduct imminent hazard evaluation of the area assess to determine the vertical and lateral extent and resample the areas in question. an ira plan was submitted on august 29, 2002. this submittal concludes that there is no imminent hazard at the southern end of the site because the contamination is fenced with temporary fencing, however it also states that the extent of the contamination has not been delineated. no imminent hazard evaluation pursuant to 310 cmr 40,0950 was conducted. the most recent ira status report for all three ira conditions was received on january 10, 2003. that report continues to state that due to access problems the prp has not delineated the imminent hazard conditions to the south. no documentation has been provided to the department to demonstrate that the prp has made efforts to gain access from the owner of the abutting property. the department contacted the prps consultant in november 2003. according to the consultant, they did not have any contract to conduct additional work at the site and had conducted no ira work since at least july 2003. the department visited the site on december 9, 2003, and found that the temporary fencing was damaged and did not restrict access to.the pcb contaminated soil at either the north or south end of the site.acopce053a012 5 3. violation the prp has failed to conduct the actions approved for all three iras at the site. for 20011634 (napl), he has failed to gauge and bail napl according to the schedule approved by the department, for several past periods of time and again most recently since july 2003. for 20011667 (the pcb contamination to the north of the site) the prp has repeatedly failed to maintain a fence that restricts access between the actively used employee parking lot and the surficial soils containing imminent hazard concentrations of pcbs. this failure was most recently documented during the departments december 9, 2003 site visit. finally, for 20014355, (pcb contamination on the south end of the site) the department specifically required that the area of pcb contamination be delineated, that that area be restricted with chain link fencing, and that an imminent hazard evaluation pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0950 be conducted. none of these requirements were met by the prp. therefore, the prp violated 310 cmr 40.0420. d. failure to submit ira status reports 1. law 310 cmr 40.0425 status reports on immediate response actions (1) unless otherwise specified in writing by the department, a person conducting immediate response actions shall submit a written status report to the department 120 days after the date on which that person first communicated to the department his or her intention to conduct that immediate response action. (2) following submission of the first such status report, additional status reports shall be submitted to the department every six months thereafter, until such time as an immediate response action completion report is submitted to the department, as described in 310 cmr 40.0427. 2. fact the department received the first ira status report for 20011634 and 20011667 combined on july 14, 1997, subsequent ira status report were not submitted within the required deadlines, and no ira status report were received between march 12, 1998 and 2001. in april 2001 the department issued an to the prp, including this violation. ira status reports were then received on july 20, 2001, january 3, 2002, july 30, 2002 (starting with this report, 20014355 is included as well), october 18, 2002, and january 10, 2003. the ira status reports required for all three release tracking numbers on july 20, 2003 and january 20, 2004 have not been submitted. 3. violation the prp has failed to submit the required ira status report for all three of the ira conditions at the site, therefore, the prp has violated 310 cmr 40.0425.(9 acopce053a012 6 e. failure to meet the performance standard for phase ii 1. law 310 cmr 40.0833 performance standards (phase ii) (1) a phase ii comprehensive site assessment shall collect, develop and evaluate sufficient information to support conclusions and opinions regarding (a) the source, nature, extent, and potential impacts of releases of oil andor hazardous material (b) the risk of harm posed by the disposal site to health, safety, public welfare and the environment and (c) the need to conduct remedial actions at the disposal site. 2. fact the department received phase ii comprehensive site assessment (csa) report on july 1, 2002. the phase ii csa was deficient. most importantly the extent of the release was not delineated. also, the report does not include an imminent hazard evaluation pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0950. rather, it simply states that an imminent hazard is present but has been abated with a fence, despite the repeatedly documented inadequacy of the fence on the northern portion of the site, and the lack of delineation of the imminent hazard conditions on the southern portion of the site. other deficiencies included that the report considered only pcb as a contaminant of concern, and did not address the lead, total petroleum hydrocarbons, and chlorinated volatile organic compounds detected at the site. the phase ii assumes that the site is not accessible to workers, though the departments site observations have been otherwise, and does not consider the scenario of trespassers on the site. though utilities are present on the northern part of the site in the vicinity of pcb hot spots, the phase ii discounts them as migration pathways with no supporting information. 3. violation the prp submitted a phase ii csa which neither delineates the extent of the release nor provides the required information regarding the risk posed by the release. therefore, the prp violated 310 cmr 40.0833(1). f, failure to meet response action deadlines 1. law 310 cmr40.0550 response action deadlines and requirements for tier i disposal sites (1) deadlines for response action outcomes. except as expressly provided by 310 cmr 40.0530(6) or 310 cmr 40.0000 or as otherwise ordered or agreed to in writing by the department, any person undertaking response actions at a tier i disposal site pursuant to a tier i permit, as described in 310 cmr 40.0700, shall achieve a response action outcome pursuant to 310 cmr 40.1000 within five years of the effective date of such permit.acopce053a012 7 (2) deadlines for submittals. except as expressly provided by 310 cmr 40.0530(6), 310 cmr 40.0550(3), or 310 cmr 40.0000, or as otherwise ordered or agreed to in writing by the department, any person undertaking response actions at a tier i disposal site pursuant to a tier i permit shall submit the following documents to the department by the following deadlines (a) ascope of work for a phase ij comprehensive site assessment pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0834 prior to the implementation of phase ii field work, unless the phase ii field work had been implemented prior to tier classification (b) phase ii report, and, if applicable, a phase ii remedial action plan within two years of the effective date of such permit (c) a phase iv remedy implementation plan within three years of the effective date of such permit (d) a response action outcome statement pursuant to 310 cmr 40.1000 within five years of the effective date of such permit and (e) any other submittal as required by the terms and conditions of a tier i permit pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0740. 2. fact the department issued the prp a tier ib permit for this site, which he accepted, and which became effective on december 8, 1997. a phase ii csa and phase iii remedial action pian (rap) were required by december 8, 1999, a phase iv remedy implementation plan (rip) by december 8, 2000, and a response action outcome statement (rao) by december 8, 2002. on april 27, 2001, the department issued a to the prp for violations including failure to submit the required phase ii, iii, and iv reports. the prp submitted and the department approved a proposal for returning to compliance which included the following phase ii soil assessment and sensitive receptor survey by 41502 phase ii groundwater assessment and imminent hazard evaluation by 51502 submittal of a phase ii csa by 7102 submittal of a phase iii rap by 71502 and, submittal of a phase iv rip and rao within deadlines to be established in a conditional permit extension. according to the prps submittals, the deadlines for completion of the soil and groundwater investigations were not met (these investigations were not even initiated until after the completion deadlines had passed). an imminent hazard evaluation pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0950 has yet to be conducted for the site, though repeatedly requested by the department. a report entitled phase ii csa was submitted on july 1, 2002. however it did not meet the performance standards for a phase itcsa. a phase iii rap was submitted on july 15, 2002. however it explicitly excluded release tracking 20014355, issued for an ira condition associated with this release.acopce053a012. 8 iv. a conditional permit extension was issued in december 2002, which established deadlines for the completion of a phase tv rip by march 1, 2003 and a rao by march 1, 2004. the prp accepted this permit extension. the phase iv rip was not submitted within the deadline, but was submitted late, after repeatedly requested by the department, on april 29, 2003, according to the lsp of record, during july 2003, the prp had ceased authorizing the consultant to conduct any work at the site. the prp did not submit the required rao by march , 2004. 3. violation the prp has failed to meet his response action deadlines and has received an for this violation. he has been late for subsequent submittals according to his proposed schedule for returning to compliance, and he has failed to submit the imminent hazard evaluation in 2002 as proposed. the prp has failed to submit the rao as required by march 1, 2004. therefore, the prp has violated 310 cmr 40.0550. 5. the parties have agreed to enter into this consent order because they agree that it is in their own interests, and in the public interest, to proceed promptly with the actions called for herein rather than to expend additional time and resources litigating the allegations set

2007, electrical power was lost at the site and backup generators were switched on, on september 16, 2007, at approximately 900 a.m., a building maintenance engineer discovered a release of fuel oil on the floor of a generator building. the engineer contacted respondent to report the oil spill. respondent allegedly determined the spill was contained to the interior of the building and a decision was made to hire a company to clean up the interior of the building. it was determined on september 16, 2007, by the maintenance engineer that the release occurred when the generators day tanks high level cut out switch failed, and oil kept pumping from the mother tank (5,000 gallon capacity) into the 150 gallon capacity day tank, causing the tank to overfill and spill oil onto the generator room floor. on september 17, 2007, respondent provided otal notification to massdep of a release of 10 gallons of fuel oil into the environment. b. on october 25, 2007, massdep issued a notice of responsibility (nor) with a request for information (rfi) to respondent, requiring respondent to submit a i completed release notification retraction form (rnf), an immediate response action (ira)

massdep received a complaint of a release of gasoline to chaffin pond, a tributary of wachusett reservoir. the release was attributed to failure of ain the matter of mass stickers plus, inc. acopce123a017 page 2 of 10 6,000gallon gasoline underground storage tank (ust) at jacks getty, 525 main street, holden. response actions conducted at the time included removal of the ust and

to 525 south main street trust on january 2, 2005. d. on july 12, 2006, respondent submitted a phase ii report (phase ii report) and phase iii remedial action plan (phase hi rap), identifying insitu chemical oxidation and monitoring as the remedial action alternative likely to achieve a permanent solution. respondent utilized limited surface water quality data from chaffin pond in preparation of the phase ii report. additionally, respondent failed to provide a complete evaluation of the horizontal and vertical extent of contamination in all media, and specifically did not include soil vapor, indoor air or sediment data from chaffin pond in the phase ii. thereby, respondent failed to adequately characterize risk at the disposal site in the phase it report, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0904.

massdep of a condition of substantial release migration (srm) at the property. exxonmobil had operated at the property until january 1, 2001, when respondent began operating at the property. exxonmobil detected the srm condition while performing response actions for a previous release of gasoline that occurred during exxonmobils operation at the property. massdep assigned release tracking number (rtn) 214440 to this srm condition and issued a notice of responsibility (nor) to exxonmobil. massdep received a written immediate response action (ira) plan from exxonmobil on october 15, 2002. on august 26, 2003, massdep issued a tier ib permit to exxonmobil corporation to conduct response actions at the site. on october 21, 2003, massdep issued a nor for this ren to respondent, the

massdep approvals and the ira plan, in violation of 310 cmr 40,0420(2) and (11) respectively. photoionization detector (pid) screening was utilized to confirm extent of contamination at the site. no laboratory analysis of soil samples was conducted after soil removal on the northern part of the excavation, outside the house, to . determine an exposure point concentration for current potentially accessible soil, in violation of 310 cmr 40,0926(1). a private drinking water well was identified approximately forty to fifty feet to the west of the release area, this well was not sampled, and no

laboratory analysis once on february 17, 2010 approximately nine months after discovery of the release. all ground water sampling results were below detection limits, this confirmed that ground water to the northeast toward the river was not impacted at that time. the close proximity of the charles river, however, establishes the potential for groundwater flow to fluctuate significantly and reverse directions at certain times during the year when the river changes from a gaining state to a losing state (and vice versa). the flow of ground water onsite may also be influenced by a curve in the charles river and the foundation of a former bridge near the release area. the release occurred in may 2009, and soil removal was not conducted until november 2009. the delay in soil removal and fluctuations of groundwater and surface water influence may have resulted in groundwater contamination migration to the north or west. in accordance with 310 cmr 40,0924(2)(b)2., the drinking water well is considered a potential exposure point for which an exposure point concentration must be determined to meet applicable standards to demonstrate a condition of no significant risk, therefore, a

(envirotrac), under the supervision of the licensed site professional of record, donald maggioli and the previous lsp, andrew stead. the method 3 risk characterization performed in support of the phase ii comprehensive site assessment determined that a condition of significant risk to onsite workers exposed to inhalation of airphase hydrocarbons (aph) based upon detection of a concentration of 1,743 micrograms per cubic meter (ugm) of total aph. the method 3 risk characterization calculated a noncancer risk hazard index of 6.8 the hazard index threshold to denote an imminent hazard is 10. b. in april 2005, indoor air samples were collected from the station at the site by envirotrac. the results are documented in laboratory reports, dated may 5, 2005, and. included in the phase iv completion statement submitted to massdep on may 20, 2005. the air sampling detected a concentration of 77,473 ugm of total aph, which exceeded the previous historic maximum concentration of 4,090 gm aph detected in december 2004. the concentrations detected in the april 2005 sample exceeded the concentrations used to determine the method 3 hazard index by approximately 36 times and exceeded the background concentration of cs cy aliphatics as described in massdeps implementation of the madep vpheph approach (policy wsc0241 1) by 767 times, indicating concentrations posing a potential imminent hazard existed in indoor air at the site. c. on july 19, 2005, the lsp of record, donald maggioli, upon his first review of the april 2005 air sampling data that had not as yet been submitted to the company, contacted massdep on behalf of the company to notify of the indoor air concentrations as a condition that could pose an imminent hazard. as a result of this notification, release tracking number rtn20015829 was issued for the site. subsequently envirotrac, on behalf of the company, conducted an imminent hazard evaluation that concluded the concentrations detected in april 2005 did pose an imminent hazard to workers at the site. d. 310 cmr 40.0311(7) required the company to notify massdep of the potential imminent hazard condition within two hours of obtaining knowledge. the company did not notify until two months later on july 19, 2005 when the lsp of record first became aware of the imminent hazard condition and first notified massdep and the company. the company also failed to perform the ira, as required by 310 cmr 40.0412, during the two months prior to notification but did institute immediate remedial response activities as required upon first becoming informed of the imminent hazard on july 19, 2005. e. massdep has also identified additional reporting and other violations associated with the site. these violations include failure of the company or its representatives to make the required oral notification to massdep of the presence of contamination in groundwater exceeding reportable concentration groundwater1 (rcgw1) within 500 feet of drinking water supply wells, as required by 310 cmr 40.0313(3), and the failure of the company or its representatives to notify massdep of mtbe detected in surface water samples from a wetland downgradient of the site in 1998 and 2001. the detections in the wetland were not addressed in the risk assessment included in the phase jfile no. acopce063a016 3 comprehensive site assessment report submitted in 2002. the company does not dispute these violations for the purposes of this consent order, but admits to no knowing failure of its reporting obligations and seeks to resolve the alleged regulatory violations by this consent order. f, massdep conducted an inspection for a level 2 audit of the phase iv comprehensive response action for release tracking 20012462 on september 7, 2005. during the audit, massdep inquired as to whether notification had been made for the apparent imminent hazard condition. envirotrac informed massdep of the july 19, 2005 notification and the issuance of release tracking 20015829. g. on october 31, 2005, massdep issued a notice of enforcement conference to the company describing the foregoing violations and setting a date to meet to discuss the violations and massdeps requirements for coming into compliance. h. on november 29, 2005, representatives of the company met with massdep personnel to present the companys response to the noncompliance described i in the notice of enforcement conference. i, on november 30, 2005, at massdeps request, the company orally notified massdep of the historical notification conditions associated with detections in the wetland and in groundwater within 500 feet of private wells. the company has proposed and massdep has approved an ira including assessment of contamination in the wetland and revision of the risk assessment to address this condition. release tracking number (rtn) 20016011 was assigned to the november 30, 2005 notification. j. on january 4, 2006, massdep issued a notice of responsibility (nor)

owner. 5. the following facts and allegations have led massdep to issue this consent order a. the site was first listed as a disposal site in 1996 under release tracking number (rtn) 20011276 and , 20015861, 20016001, 20016232, 20016250, 20016528, 20016619 were subsequently issued and linked to the site due to additional notification conditions. initially, mcp response actions were conducted by the property owners, richard, mark, andor ellen sax (the saxls). in august 2006, the saxls formed pin hill, llc (respondent), and since that time, respondent has conducted all mcp response actions and has expressly assumed responsibility for the site. b. the property, once a singlefamily residence rented to a tenant, is now unoccupied. chlorinated volatile organic compounds (cvoc) and fuel oil containing mtbe have been released at the site and have contaminated the bedrock aquifer. the property and surrounding residences are served by private drinking water wells. sampling by the saxls discovered that two wells contained contamination associated with the site. bottled water and treatment systems were provided to the affected residents. in 2002, the saxls filed a remedy operation status (ros) opinion for the site. er massdep audited the ros opinion beginning in august 2005. as described in the january 13, 2006 notice of audit findings and (non), one of massdeps findings was that there was inadequate data to support the conclusions necessary to obtain ros. by failing to meet the performance standard for ros, the saxls violated 310 cmr 40.0893(2). the non required that the saxls terminate the ros, and, among other things, submit a revised phase ii comprehensive site assessment (csa), phase iii remedial action plan (rap), and phase iv remedy implementation plan (rip) by january 12, 2007, documenting adequate site characterization and remedial alternative selection and design. d. on january 13, 2007, respondent submitted a revised phase ii csa, phase ii rap and phase iv rip. massdep reviewed these submittals and determined that the submittals failed to comply with mcp pellbenane standards for reasons described in paragraphs se, f, and g below. ex pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0833(1), in conducting the phase ii csa respondent must, among other things, collect, develop and evaluate sufficient information to support conclusions regarding the source, nature, extent, and potential impacts of releases, and the need to conduct remedial actions at the disposal site. respondents phase ii csa report failed to adequately characterize site conditions or provide enough information to determine the most effective remedial options, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0833(1). specifically, massdep found the following deficiencies in the phase ii reporttn the matter of pin hill llc acopce093e001 page 3 of 13 i. hydrogeological characteristics of the bedrock aquifer have not been assessed at the site, and zones of contamination within bedrock at the source area or in the former sax private drinking water well have not been evaluated. in addition, offproperty contaminant migration from the site has been inadequately characterized as required in order to determine what is the most appropriate remedial action(s) for the site. as a result, hydrogeological data provided in the phase it csa fails to comply with the requirements of 310 cmr 40.0835(4)(d). ii. the release source area is not adequately delineated. due to insufficient assessment in the source area, the possibility of an area of high concentrations of cvoc in bedrock acting as a continuing source cannot be eliminated as the cause of increased cvoc concentrations. failure to adequately assess the release area is a violation of 310 cmr 40.0835(4)(f). f, pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0853, a phase iit rap must identify and evaluate remedial alternatives reasonably likely to achieve a condition of no significant risk. the phase iii rap must also describe and document the information, reasoning and results used to identify and evaluate remedial action alternatives in sufficient detail to support the selection of the proposed remedial action alternative. respondents phase ii rap and phase iv rip proposed a permanent solution consisting of hydraulic containment and monitored natural attenuation (mna) to treat contaminated groundwater at the site. this remedy was unsupported by the phase iii rap, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0853. specifically, massdep identified the following deficiencies in the phase iti rap i. as described in paragraph 5e, respondent has not adequately delineated the release nor has respondent established that the source of the contamination has been eliminated or controlled. therefore, inadequate information is available to support the selection of mna as a likely permanent solution for the site. ii. breakdown products of cvoc have not been detected in groundwater samples collected at the site. respondent has not conducted testing for other mna parameters such as ph, dissolved oxygen, chloride and redox potential. therefore, the selection of mna as a likely permanent solution for the release is not supported by available data. g. pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0872, a phase v rip must ensure that the design of the remedial alternative is sufficiently developed to support the implementation of the remedial action, to ensure that it meets the response action performance standard described at 310 cmr 40.0191. the phase iv rip does not meet the applicable phase iv performance standards due to multiple failures of the proposed design. deficiencies identified in the phase iv rip include the followingin the matter of pin hill llc acopce093e001 page 4 of 13 i. ii. iii. iv. vi. h. carbon units on the point of entry treatment system at the property were sized specifically for use in treating potable drinking water. the phase iv rip proposes to remediate contaminated groundwater by converting the original private drinking water supply well to a groundwater recovery well, which will substantially increase the volume of water requiring treatment. the phase iv rip fails to demonstrate that existing carbon units are sized appropriately to treat the increased volume of groundwater. water samples collected from the saxl well carbon units on april 26, 2006 indicated that both untreated and effluent water samples contained tetrachloroethene (pce) concentrations well above the reportable concentration of 5 micrograms per liter (ugl). the phase iv rip does not provide design features that prevent or limit accidental discharge of pce contaminated groundwater exceeding reportable concentrations as required by 310 cmr 40.0045(3)(a)(1). the phase iv rip proposes the future discharge of treated groundwater into injection well w1 after influent pce concentrations fall below 200 ugl. however, the phase iv rip fails to substantiate how the treatment system is designed to prevent or limit the discharge of dissolved pce at concentrations exceeding reportable concentrations to avoid potential contamination of downgradient drinking water wells. as described in paragraph 5h, an imminent hazard has been reported at the site, associated with the intrusion of cvoc vapors into the residence. because the existing drinking water supply well is proposed to be used as a groundwater recovery well, pce contaminated groundwater will continue to be pulled toward the residential building, potentially resulting in increased indoor air impacts via the subslab utility chase or vapor migration from underlying groundwater. the phase iv rip fails to ensure that indoor air is not impacted during groundwater recovery operations at the site, as. required by 310 cmr 40.0874(3)(b)9. the phase iv rip does not provide a contingency plan to resolve discharge limit exceedances, as required by 310 cmr 40.0874(3)(b)7. mna was chosen in conjunction with hydraulic containment as a permanent solution at the site. the proposed mna monitoring does not meet guidance published by united states environmental protection agency (usepa), american society for testing and materials (astm), or massdep guidance, and is inadequate for evaluating the effectiveness of mna. in addition, the phase iv rip does not propose a contingency plan for alternative remedial actions should mna prove ineffective, as recommended by both usepa and astm guidance. on january 5, 2007, respondent notified massdep that during additional assessment required by the non, air sampling revealed indoor concentrations of cvocin the matter of pin hill llc acopce093e001 page 5 of 13 posing an imminent hazard (ih) to the tenant and two children then residing at the property. the ih was assigned . on january 5, 2007, massdep verbally approved respondents immediate response action (ira) plan, including a temporary ventilation system. sampling conducted the next day indicated that the temporary system was initially successful in reducing cvocs and alleviating the ih. after an inspection on january 10, 2007, however, massdep modified the ira approval and specified that, because the fragile temporary system (consisting of a blower and a length of plastic film tubing) would not withstand normal winter weather conditions, a more durable, permanent system must be installed as soon as possible. i. on march 6, 2007, respondent submitted an ira plan which stated that a permanent system had not been installed because the tenant would be vacating the residence on march 23, 2007. on march 15, 2007, massdep conducted an announced field inspection and met with respondents licensed site professional (lsp) and its tenant. during the inspection, massdep confirmed that the temporary system had not been upgraded as required in the ira approval. the lsp informed massdep that (1) respondent relied on sporadic site visits and the tenant to notify respondent of problems with the system rather than providing adequate monitoring itself (2) there had been multiple incidents when the system was damaged or nonoperational as documented by statements and photographs provided by the tenant (3) the tenant was not provided with full information regarding the ih and (4) the tenant had not been provided with or received notice from respondent regarding his allegedly vacating of the property on march 23, 2007. j. on march 23, 2007, massdep issued to respondent a written denial of the ira plan and a notice of response action and notice of intent to mobilize, stating massdeps intention to proceed with statefunded response actions unless respondent installed a permanent and effective subslab ventilation system to address the ih condition, and an acceptable monitoring and maintanence plan. respondent failed to correct the situation until march 27, 2007, after massdep informed respondent verbally of massdeps intent to conduct the work and pursue cost recovery through issuance of a notice of response action and notice of intent to mobilize. on april 20, 2007, massdep confirmed that the upgraded ventilation system was operational with an automated telemetry system providing telephone notification to the lsp of system shutdown. ongoing indoor air sampling indicates only trace levels of cvoc, no longer posing an jh. k. pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0411(7), parties undertaking mcp response actions must continually assess and evaluate site conditions to determine if an ira is required. because respondent knew that the temporary system was inadequate and site conditions posed an ih, respondent was required to continuously monitor the temporary

obtain approval for a significant modification to an immediate response action (ira). on february 7, 1996, an ira plan was received by the department that specified collection of fuel oil nonaqueous phase liquid (napl) using a pneumatic skimmer. the napl recovery system was orally approved by the department on march 18, 1996. the napl recovery system was activated on april 1, 1996. thecatholic charities, 210720211029 2 administrative consent order wpenalty 15 ripley st., worcester acopce053a014 ira completion statement received by the department on june 20, 2001, indicated that operation of the recovery system was shut down some time in mid1999. no exact date was provided. technical justification for deactivation prior to implementation of comprehensive response actions was not provided in the ira completion statement. deactivation of the napl recovery system constitutes a significant modification to the ira. an ira plan modification was not submitted to the department prior to deactivating the approved skimmer pump. deactivation of the recovery system was not approved by the department, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0420(6). b, failure to stabilize site conditions prior to submitting an immediate response action completion statement. the pneumatic bailing system that was approved as an ira to reduce the level of napl in monitoring wells at the site was discontinued in mid1999, thicknesses of napl found to be present within monitoring well cee1 had ranged from 3.34 feet in october 1997 to 23.99 feet in march 1998, napl thickness since deactivation in 1999 has ranged from 5.35 feet in june 2001 to 18.85 feet in may 2003. passive bailing, conducted as a comprehensive response action, was not initiated until february 2001. an ira completion statement was received by the department on june 20, 2001. levels of napl increased after the recovery system was shut down and passive bailing was initiated as a comprehensive response action, therefore, the ira completion statement was submitted before the site conditions giving rise to the ira were stabilized, in violation of 310 cmr 40,0427(1)(a). c. failure to reclassify a disposal site. the site was classified as tier ii in 1996 with a numerical ranking system (nrs) score of 263. borings advanced and monitoring wells installed in 1998 revealed the presence of napl six inches below the boiler roommaintenance office. air monitoring results from samples collected in october 1999 within the onsite residential building contained petroleum hydrocarbons above background concentrations. detected indoor air concentrations above background levels are considered a likely or confirmed exposure pathway, which would change the numerical ranking system score to 363, exceeding the tier ic threshold score of 350. additionally, oil or hazardous materials (ohm) toxicity scores were incorrectly based on dissolved concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons in groundwater rather than napl. a revised nrs scoresheet and a tier i permit application was not submitted to the department, in violation of 3 10 cmr 40.0530(1).catholic charities, 210720211029 3 administrative consent order wpenalty 15 ripley st., worcester acopce053a014 d. failure to meet phase iii performance standards. a phase iii remedial action plan (rap) was received by the department on february 17, 2000. the phase iii considers three remedial alternatives as technically feasible (1) soil excavation for source removal of subsurface petroleum (2) high vacuum extraction (hve) of liquid phase petroleum and (3) collection of oil with passive diffusion bailers. boring logs indicate that as many as 75 blows were required to advance a split spoon soil collector six inches. test pit logs uniformly indicate that soils consisted of fine grain sand and clay and are described as dense, which is typically considered less conducive to passive recovery than hve or soil excavation. passive recovery was selected based upon the relative cost in comparison with hve and soil excavation. the phase iii rap states, alternative 1 (passive recovery) would attain a temporary solution relatively rapidly (i.e. within six months). on the other hand, product recovery would likely be ongoing for decades. the other two alternatives were reported to take from six months to three years to achieve a permanent solution. in addition, the report acknowledges that passive recovery posed higher future exposure risk, the phase iii rap estimated approximately 2,500 gallons of fuel oil product to be located within a limited area of approximately 11,250 square feet. the phase iii cost estimate table estimates that approximately 400 gallons of product could be removed from the subsurface annually with passive recovery. between august 2002 and june 2003, the passive bailers recovered 3.53 gallons. approximately 540 gallons of oil and water were collected via the pneumatic skimmer pump utilized during ira activities from april 1996 to 1999, the phase ii rap failed to select an effective remedial alternative that is reasonably likely to achieve a level of no significant risk in a timely manner taking into consideration site characteristics in comparison to other feasible technologies, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0853. e. failure to meet class c response action outcome requirements. the class c response action outcome (rao) statement described only operation of the passive recovery system (temporary solution) in the portion devoted to achieving a permanent solution. at the passive napl recovery rate of less than 5 gallonsyear, it would take more than 500 years to remove the estimated volume of oil product in the subsurface environment. a section of the rao is entitled steps toward a permanent solution. however, no definitive and enterprising steps were described, such as contingencies if remedial goals (e.g. product recovery estimates) were not met, in violation of 310 cmr 40.01050(5)(a).catholic charities,

conducted to evaluate the feasibility of manual bailing and vacuum extraction. the pilot tests demonstrated manual bailing to be effective to reduce and maintain napl thicknesses. on november 10, 2004, the department received a periodic evaluation of the temporary solution recommending continued manual bailing at a frequency of an approximately threeweek basis to allow a recoverable amount of napl to accumulate at thicknesses of approximately 1.5 ft. in monitoring wells cee1 and cee2 and 0.25 ft. in monitoring well gzas5. . the parties have agreed to enter into this consent order because

(waverly) to respond to the fuel oil odor and grinding noise. waverly removed the housing on the generator and observed a fuel oil film present on top of the ast. waverly determined that the source of the fuel oil was from a faulty sensor that caused fuel oil to automatically transfer fuel out the ust, into the already full ast causing 2 fuel oil to overflow the ast. waverly personnel disconnected the automatic fill system from the ust and cleaned the 2 fuel oil off the ast with rags. waverly then notified respondent that a 2 fuel oil release occurred from the ast at the site. e. on september 21, 2011, a complaint of fuel oi odors inside the arthur a. coia conferenceadministration building was investigated by respondent. the source of the odor was determined to be from 2 fuel oil that surfaced in a sump pump in the basement mechanical room of the building. the alleged source of the fuel oil in the sump pump is from the automatic transfer and release of fuel oil that occurred at the ast in april 2011. the reported distance between the generator ast and sump pump is approximately 140 feet. f. respondent retained williamson environmental, llc (williamson) on september 21, 2011 to

oil company, inc. acopce063a015 . page 2 of 7 5. the following facts have led massdep to issue this consent order a. respondent referenced its water supply as a private water supply well in multiple submittals to massdep when it is, although privatelyowned and operated, a public water system (pws), as defined under 310 cmr 22,02. therefore, massdep alleges that respondent made inaccurate statements in its submittals, in violation of 310 cmr 40,0022(2). specifically, the pws well was referenced as one of several private drinking water wells in the vicinity of the site sic in the following submittals phase i report submitted november 1, 2001 and immediate response action (ira) status reports dated january 8, 2001, june 1, 2001, and november 7, 2001. furthermore, respondent referenced the pws as a private water supply well in the following submittals ira plans submitted april 30, 2002, april 23, 2004, and november 30, 2004 ira status reports submitted october 30, 2002, april 28, 2003, and july 9, 2004 the phase ii scope of work submitted september 30, 2003 the phase ii comprehensive site assessment report dated november 23, 2004. the march 24, 2005 phase iii remedial action plan correctly described the well as an unregistered pws, however, the subsequent june 8, 2005 ira status report reverted to the statement the property is served by a private water supply well. b. massdep alleges that respondent failed to notify massdep within 72 hours of obtaining knowledge of a substantial release migration (srm) condition in violation of 310 cmr 40.0313(5). massdep alleges that detection of siterelated contamination in a pws well constitutes a srm condition as defined at 310 cmr 40.0006 and that 310 cmr 40.0313(5) required respondent to provide oral notification to massdep immediately and no later than 72hours from obtaining knowledge of the srm. the impact of the release on private water supply wells had been included as part of the siterelated information collected and described in 2000 and 2001, and these conditions were addressed under an immediate response action (ira) plan. however, siterelated . contamination of the pws well was first detected in a sample collected from the pws in march 2003. the contamination was confirmed in five subsequent sampling events in april 2003, july 2003, october 2003, february 2004, and september 2004. massdep was onsite during the sampling in april 2003, and the issue of srm was not raised by massdep in the may 27, 2003 notice of audit finding. from the time of detection of contamination in the pws in march 2003 until the submittal of an ira plan modification in november 2004, respondent took no action to eliminate or mitigate this critical exposure pathway during the performance of its ira as required by 310 cmr 40.0414(3). respondent did not provide separate srm notification with respect to the pws well until specifically requested to do so during an audit inspection conducted by massdep on december 8, 2004. as directed by massdep, respondent notified massdep of the srm for the pws well on december 10, 2004. c. massdep alleges that respondent failed to submit a timely revised tier classification submittal in violation of 310 cmr 40.0530, respondent submitted a tier classification submittal in 2001, which stated that there were no surface waterwetlands within 500 feet. subsequently, respondent submitted a revised tier classification submittal in novemberin the matter of peterborough oil company, inc. acopce063a015 page 3 of 7 2004, asserting that the site classification must be changed from tier ii to tier ic as a result of detections in a stream 100 feet from the release. the detection of mtbe in the stream first occurred on february 17, 2004, and was confirmed on match 3, 2004. subsequent sampling during april, may, june and september 2004 indicated transient detections of mtbe. the respondent alleges that such detections could have been indicative of an impact by runoff from the nearby roadway, however, massdep alleges . that respondent did not conduct an investigation to gather the necessary data to support this allegation either within the sixtyday time period or subsequently. therefore pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0530, massdep alleges that rescoring was required within sixty days of the first detection, ie., by april 18, 2004. respondent did submit the revised tier classification submittal on november 23, 2004. . d. because the numerical ranking system (nrs) scoresheet submitted with the revised tier classification in november 2004 did not acknowledge or score for the presence of the pws well at the site, failed to recognize the inclusionary criterion of the interim wellhead protection area (iwpa), and scored zero points for the presence of indoor air contamination, massdep alleges that respondent violated 310 cmr 40.0520(1). in november 2000, gasoline vapors were reported in the basement and well vault of the adjacent package store. up to 7 (in the basement) and up to 15 (in the well vault) of the lower explosive limit (lel) were measured by lel meter. a soil vapor extraction system (sves) was installed november 2000 and operated until august 2002. following deactivation of the system, indoor air was monitored using a photoionization detector (pid) and lel meter. pid and lel readings were low with a maximum of 0.6 parts per million (ppm), however, no laboratory analysis of indoor air was conducted to confirm that indoor air was not impacted by the release in order to support the score of zero for indoor air contamination, at massdeps request, in january 2005, indoor air samples were collected and analyzed in the basement and the first floor. contamination was detected in excess of established background levels only in the first floor, for two hydrocarbon fractions that were not detected in excess of established background levels in the basement sample and that had not been detected in groundwater samples since 2000, 310 cmr 40.0520(l) required that respondent score the site using the nrs as described in 310 cmr 40.1500, based upon data, facts and other information obtained during phase i, and any other relevant data, facts or information known by respondent. therefore, at the time of the tier classification, massdep alleges that the respondent should have acknowledged the pws well and that the potential for indoor air contamination also should have been included. e. respondent has failed to meet response action deadlines in violation of 310 cmr 40,0560(2). the site was originally tier classified by respondent as tier ii on november 1, 2001. as described at 310 cmr 40.0560(2), a phase ii comprehensive site assessment and phase iii remedial action plan were required by november 1, 2003 and a phase iv remedy implementation plan was required by november 1, 2004. on october 28, 2003, a notice of delay letter was submitted for respondent in accordance with 310 cmr

(santander). the third property is 402 grove street, owned by altab and the location of a single story restaurant building. the santander driveway bifurcates the 400 grove street and 402 grove street parcels. groundwater is believed to generally flow in a northwest to southeast direction. b. the site was first identified as a location to be investigated in 1989 due to historic petroleum contamination associated with former service station operations at the 400 grove street property and was assigned . chlorinated hydrocarbons were subsequently identified in soil and groundwater on all three parcels. c. in february 2007, an imminent hazard was identified due to elevated concentrations of tetrachloroethylene in indoor air at the 400 grove street building and was mitigated by the installation of a subslab venting system and periodic indoor air quality sampling to ensure effectiveness of exposure pathway control. this release was assigned . d. on april 14, 2010, a temporary solution intended to achieve a permanent solution was submitted for the 400 grove street and 402 grove street portions of the site. the plan to achieve a permanent solution for the 400 grove and 402 grove street parcels relied upon implementation of a proposed chemical oxidation remediation system conducted by santander despite santanders stated intentions in its own separate remedial plan to limit remedial application principally to the driveway portion of the site owned by santander. e. on july 14, 2010, santander submitted a partial permanent solution for the driveway portion of the site, indicating that there would be no further operation of the remediation system by the bank. by relying on a system operated by a third party that was limited in scope both geographically and

indoor air during the november 22, 2008 indoor air sampling event constituted a condition requiring notification within 72 hours, as required by 310 cmr 40.0313(5). respondent did not notify massdep of the detection of aph and cvoc concentrations in indoor air at a residence. failure to notify massdep of a 72hour notification condition consisting of a condition of substantial release migration (srm) as indicated by a release to the groundwater that has resulted in the discharge of vapors into an occupied residential dwelling is a violation of 310 cmr 40.0313(5). . k. the srm 72hour notification condition required an immediate response action (ira) to be conducted, as stipulated in 310 cmr 40,.0412(2) and 310 cmr 40.0414(3), to eliminate andor mitigate a critical exposure pathway (cep), the route by which the vaporphase emissions of oil andor hazardous material are transported into the living or working space of the occupied residential dwelling. an ira was not conducted to eliminate andor mitigate the cep at.the disposal site, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0412(2) and 310 cmr 40.0414(3). in addition, technical justification was not provided to demonstrate that the cep does not and will not, for the time period that is likely to be required for the implementation andor completion of comprehensivein the matter of timothy orourke and margaret orourke acopce113a006 page 4 of 12 response actions, present an imminent hazard and it is not feasible to eliminate or mitigate the cep as specified by 310 cmr 40.0414 (3)(a), (b) and (c). ds on december 1, 2008, massdep received a combined phase ii completion statement, phase ii completion statement, ram completion statement, and a revised tier classification submitted by respondent. the phase ii contained a screeninglevel evaluation of human health risk posed by certain volatile contaminants detected in indoor air utilizing madeps imminent hazard evaluation for resident exposed in chemicals in indoor air short form 2006. the evaluation used exposure point concentrations (epc) equivalent to the maximum concentration of aph compounds measured in the basement indoor air which resulted in a hazard index of 1.0. naphthalene and tce were not included in the risk assessment as contaminants of concern, and a technical justification was not supplied for the omission. m. the phase ii selected method 1 as the risk characterization approach for the site based on the assumptions that impact was limited to soil and groundwater, and human receptors would potentially be exposed predominantly through contact with soil and groundwater. the phase ii inappropriately used method 1 to characterize riskat the disposal site, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0942(1)(b), as oil and hazardous material (i.e. aph and cvoc) were present in an environmental medium (i.e. indoor air) in addition to soil and groundwater. further, the phase i failed to demonstrate that human receptors could potentially be exposed predominantly through contact with soil and groundwater as specified in 310 cmr 40.0942(1)(b)1., given the dwelling utilized a fieldstone foundation, and the fact that contaminated soil and groundwater were located at depth in front of the residence and below the concrete basement floor. n. the december 2008 revised tier classification reduced the overall site numerical ranking system (nrs) score from 288 to 272, and thereby did not identify a need to change the tier classification. the revised ranking kept the indoor air exposure , pathway rank at 100 based on the assertion that a potential exposure pathway existed for aph fractions reported in indoor air at concentrations below the 90 percentile threshold values of typical indoor air concentrations for the reported compounds, in fact, the results of november 2008 indoor air analyses indicated the presence of aph and a chlorinated volatile organic compound (cvoc) in the basement at concentrations above the threshold values at which multiple lines of evidence are required as provided in table 1 of madeps indoor air threshold values for the evaluation of a vapor intrusion pathway draft technical update policy 08xxx, madep, june 26, 2008. the following, compounds exceeded the thr esholds identified in table 1 cscg aromatics at 110 ugm, cocj2 aliphatics at 160 ugm, and co cio aromatics at 23 ugm. further, the detection limit of naphthalene at 2.0 ugm and detection of a cvoc, trichloroethylene (tce), at 22 ugm also exceeded respective thresholds. despite exceeding thresholds, an evaluation utilizing multiple lines of evidence was not provided to demonstrate that a vapor intrusion pathway did not exist.in the matter of timothy orourke and margaret orourke acopce113a006 page 5 of 12 the nrs revision failed to identify a confirmed exposure pathway and assign a value of 200 to the indoor air confirmed pathway as substantiated by the existence of aph and cvoc above background, in violation of 310 cmr 40.15 12(4). in addition, a tier i. permit was not submitted to massdep within 60 days of rescoring, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0530(2), and work at the disposal site progressed without a tier i permit, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0702(4). 0, on february 17, 2009, massdep received a phase iv remedy implementation plan (rip). the rip presented a schedule for implerenting the selected remedial alternative which called for monthly enhanced fluid recovery (efr) events, and quarterly groundwater and indoor air sampling fo begin in march 2009. the initial efr and monitoring frequency would continue for the first six months, with subsequent activities consisting of efr events as necessary, and long term quarterly monitoring until a class c response action outcome (rao), at a minimum, is achieved. in addition, the february 2009 phase iv rip did not contain a health and safety plan, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0874(3) (e). p, general provisions for phase iv responseactions were not met at the disposal site, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0871(6), as the phased iv implementation did not conform to the proposals and specifications contained in the rip one efr event was conducted on august 25, 2009, and groundwaterindoor air was last monitored prior to the phase iv rip. in addition, phase iv status reports addressing a srm condition have not been submitted monthly, in violation of 310 cmr

the method 3 risk characterization identified construction workers as potential future receptors at the site. subsurface soil was considered the likely exposure point. dermal contact and incidental ingestion of contaminated soil and inhalation of contaminated particulates were the likely exposure pathways. inhalation of volatile organic compounds (vocs) in ambient air was not evaluated as a potential exposure pathway. concentrations of vocs, especially benzene, are present at levels that could result in a substantial hazard or imminent hazard at several hot spots at the site. benzene

an approximate one acre portion of the one hundred thirtysix acre property owned by respondent. the site comprises the arthur a. coia conferenceadministration building that is serviced by a four thousand gallon fiberglass 2 fuel oil underground storage tank (the ust) to heat the building and to fuel a nearby diesel powered electric generator for emergency power to the building. the generator is a self contained unit that is structurally mounted on top of a steel rectangular shaped 200 gallon above ground storage tank (the ast). the ast is fueled by the larger ust by an automatic fuel delivery system, via high and low volume transfer sensors. sometime prior to april 5, 2011, this automatic fuel delivery system failed, and 2 fuel oil overflowed the ast, causing a release to the environment. b. on september 21, 2011, massdep received notification from the hopkinton fire department that 1,000 gallons of 2 fuel oil were released to the environment at the site. the source of the release was from the above mentioned ustast delivery system, and the time of the release was unknown. massdep received information from respondent that the released volume of 2 fuel oil was at least 1,000 gallons, and the release likely was related to a response to a no heat call at the facility. massdep requested and received written information from respondent, which included two years of fuel oil delivery records that support the reported 1,000 gallon release at the site. c. information provided by respondent to massdep stated that on april 4, 2011, respondent received delivery of 2,887 gallons of 2 fuel oil to the ust at the site. a review of the 2 year delivery history (inventory records) provided by respondent, indicates the 1,000 gallon fuel oil release occurred at this time. the fuel oil delivery of 2,887 gallons was 1,000 gallons more than any of the other seventeen (17) deliveries made to this ust over a two year period between january 2010 and december 2011. d. information provided by respondent to massdep stated that on april 5, 2011, respondent discovered a fuel oil odor and grinding noise within the vicinity of the emergency diesel powered electric generator for the building. on that same day, respondent engaged the services of waverly tool rental sales co., inc.in the matter of new england laborers training trust fund and trustees of the new england laborers trust fund acopce133e011sepnt page 3 of 12 (waverly) to respond to the fuel oil odor and grinding noise. waverly removed the housing on the generator and observed a fuel oil film present on top of the ast. waverly determined that the source of the fuel oil was from a faulty sensor that caused fuel oil to automatically transfer fuel out the ust, into the already full ast, causing 2 fuel oil to overflow the ast. waverly personnel disconnected the automatic fill system from the ust and cleaned the 2 fuel oil off the ast with rags. waverly then notified respondent that a 2 fuel oil release occurred from the ast at the site. e. on september 21, 2011, a complaint of fuel oil odors inside the arthur a. coia conferenceadministration building was investigated by respondent. the source of the odor was determined to be from 2 fuel oil that surfaced in a sump pump in the basement mechanical room of the building. the alleged source of the fuel oil in the sump pump is from the automatic transfer and release of fuel oil that occurred at the ast in april 2011. the reported distance between the generator ast and sump pump is approximately 140 feet. f. respondent retained williamson environmental, llc (williamson) on september 21, 2011 to perform the immediate response actions (ira) and to provide licensed site professional (lsp) services. massdep then approved the verbal ira plan to include removal of water and oil from the impacted sump in the building, assess for indoor air impacts, conduct regular indoor air screening, install absorbent booms in the nearby pond to prevent impacts, inspect a nearby stream, screen underground utilities for fuel oil impacts, sample the onsite public water system (pws) well to analyze for fuel oil compounds, and remove up to 100 cubic yards of impacted soil for proper disposal as remediation waste. massdep requested the installation of groundwater wells to actively recover fuel oil from the subsurface. g, on january 17, 2012, massdep issued a notice of responsibility with a request for information (rfi) to respondent for this release. the stated deadline to respond to the rfi was january 26, 2012. h. on january 26, 2012, respondent submitted a written response to the rfi issued on january 17, 2012. respondent indicated in its rfi response that waverly responded to investigate the fuel oil odor and grinding noise at the generator on april 5, 2011. respondent stated that waverly cleaned oil off the top of the ast, disconnected the automatic fuel feed system, and had no reason to believe that greater than 10 gallons of 2 fuel oil had been released. the rfi response stated that respondent first obtained knowledge that a release of oil had occurred at the site on september 21, 2011. information and fuel oil

a written ira plan for this release that was received by massdep on december 5, 2011. the ira plan summarized soil removal activities, pws well sample data, indoor air screening, installation of groundwater monitor wells and the installation of an automated fuel oil recovery system to remove 2 fuel oil from groundwater and temporarily store 55gallon drums inside respondents facility. as of the date of the ira plan submittal, thirty cubic yards of impacted soil had been excavated and properly disposed off site, and a total of one hundred sixty gallons of 2 fuel oil had been removed from groundwater and temporarily stored in 55gallon drums. j. respondent submitted a written ira status report for this release that was received by massdep on january 26, 2012. the ira status report summarized continued pws well sample data, indoor air screening, surface water sample data, and updated the volume of fuel oil removed off the groundwater to one hundred ninety gallons. k. on february 1, 2012, massdep conducted a site inspection with thomas williamson, jr., lsp, representing respondent. massdep discussed concerns about continued indoor air screeningsampling, surface waterstream sampling, product recovery and critical exposure pathways at the site. the need for additional subsurface assessment was discussed in the area directly around the pws well on the site. massdep requested that respondents lsp submit an ira modification letter to address these concerns, and to include time lines for completing the above requested assessment activities. l. pursuant to 310 cmr

for the site as the current owner and operator of the property. 5. the following facts and allegations have led massdep to issue this consent orderin the matter of emerald realty trust acopce093a003 page 2 of 10 a. the property was listed in 1988 for a release of gasoline to soil and groundwater. the prior owner did not complete the necessary response actions. respondent purchased it on august 1, 2003 with the plan of developing the property into a donut shop. b. on march 9, 2004, respondent entered into an administrative consent order (aco) with massdep, establishing timelines for completion of the necessary assessment and cleanup of the site. the aco was extended twice in amendments executed on january 25, 2005 and december 15, 2005. a third amendment was requested and denied by massdep in a letter dated march 29, 2006. in that letter, massdep stated that although the aco would not be amended, massdep would not pursue enforcement if respondent submitted a phase iv remedy implementation plan (rip), phase iv completion statement, and either a remedy operation status (ros) opinion or response action outcome statement (rao) by april 28, 2006. c. on may 19, 2006, respondent submitted a phase iv rip and ros opinion. the submittals proposed to remediate the gasoline release at the property through the implementation of monitored natural attenuation (mna). massdep audited the submittals and identified the following violations . i. pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0191(2), response actions shall consider relevant policies and guidelines issued by massdep and usepa, and shall use practices that are appropriate and generally accepted by the professional community. the proposal for mna does not comply with this requirement because, among other things, respondent has failed to delineate the extent of contamination, respondent has not established that the plume is stable or shrinking, and respondents sampling locations, frequency and analytical parameters are inconsistant with published mna guidance of massdep, usepa, andor american society for testing and materials (astm). in addition, 310 cmr 40.0191(3) requires that where feasible, technologies be considered that resuse, recycle, detoxify or treat the contaminants. groundwater has not been sampled for geochemical parameters to demonstrate that natural attenuation is occuring as a destructive process. respondent has therefore violated 310 cmr 40.0191(2) and (3). ii. pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0893(2), the remedial program established under ros shall be adequately designed to achieve a permanent solution, each source of contamination shall be eliminated and controlled, and any substantial hazard shall be eliminated. as described above, the proposed remedy does not comply with multiple published guidance documents and there is inadequate information to conclude that it would achieve a permanent solution. in addition, without full delineation of the release it is inappropriate to conclude that no substantial hazard exists. finally, the proposed remedy relies on excavation of source area soil, which respondent has failed to conduct. therefore, an uncontrolled source may still be present at the site. therefore, respondent has violated 310 cmr 40.0893(2).in the matter of emerald realty trust acopce093a003 page 3 of 10 iii, pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0874(3), a phase iv rip must include an operation, maintenance, and monitoring (omm7) plan and a health and safety plan. the rip erroneously states that these items are not required. while the rip does propose limited monitoring, the monitoring, as described above, does not comply with published guidance for mna and is not adequately protective for potential indoor air impacts at downgradient residences. therefore, respondent has violated 310 cmr 40.0874(3). iv. pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0879(1), respondent must submit a phase iv completion statement upon completion of the phase iv activities and prior to submission of a ros opinion. in addition, the phase v completion statement was required by a prior aco issued by massdep to respondent. respondent remains in violation of these requirements by failing to submit the phase v completion statement. v. the may 19, 2006 submittal did not contain copies or other documentation that the required notice had been provided to the chief municipal officer and board of health, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0880(1) and 310 cmr 40.1403(3). d. respondent received a (non) on october 16, 2006, describing the violations listed above. the non requested a revised submittal within 180 days of the non, or by april 14,2007. respondent failed to return to compliance in response to the non. e. subsequent to the issuance of the non, massdep identified an additional violation for related release tracking number (rtn) 20015270. this rtn is associated with gasoline contamination in shallow groundwater adjacent to a downgradient residence. respondents assessment conducted in response to this condition confirmed the presence of low concentrations of siterelated contamination in the residential indoor air. laboratory analyses of the most recent samples collected in february 2006 did not detect contamination in the indoor air. this assessment is documented in the ros submittal. because the condition is a 2hour notification condition, the assessment was initiated as an immediate response action (ira). an jraplan was submitted in october 2004 and a single ira status report was submitted on february 8, 2005. however, 310 cmr 40.0425(2) requires the submittal of ira status reports every six months until an ira completion statement is filed. by failing to file the ira completion statement or ira status reports, respondent has violated 310 cmr 40.0425(2). f. on october 2, 2007, massdep personnel observed the excavation of utility trenches at the site in the area of the former underground storage tanks and pump islands that have been identified as the source of petroleum contamination at the site. massdep contacted respondents licensed site professional (lsp), who was unaware of the excavation work. g. on october 3, 2007, massdep personnel conducted a site inspection, and observed utility trenching in relation to the documented contamination at the site.in the matter of emerald realty trust acopce093 a003 page 4 of 10 h. therefore, massdep determines that, in addition to the previouslyidentified violations, respondent conducted a uram without the required notice to massdep, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0462(1)(b). i. on october 19, 2007, respondent submitted a proposal for returning the site to compliance. respondent proposed to install and sample additional monitoring wells on the property. respondent proposed to employ a numerical model to estimate the extent of the contamination in groundwater, and to submit a response action outcome statement. respondent has not retracted the ros submittal or addressed other violations including the lack of a health and safety plan, immediate response action completion statement, substantial hazard evaluation, and possible ongoing source area associated with contaminated soil in the vicinity of the pump island.",2009,2-0000394,SPENCER,https://eeaonline.eea.state.ma.us/EEA/fileviewer/Rtn.aspx?rtn=2-0000394

acopce113a006 page 2 of 12 a. worcester dynamy, a not for profit corporation, purchased the real property, a six (6) unit wood frame apartment building, located at 110 highland street, worcester, . massachusetts, on august 25, 1981 as recorded in the worcester district repisty of deeds at book 7305page 1 53. b. in june and july 2004, a limited subsurface investigation was conducted to evaluate the soil surrounding a fuel oil underground storage tank (ust) beneath the concrete basement floor of the site structure. soil samples collected from borings were reported to contain concentrations of volatile petroleum hydrocarbon (vph) fraction and extractable petroleum hydrocarbon (eph) fractions that exceed the applicable mcp rcs1 reportable standards for eph and vph compounds. c. . on december 1, 2004, two (2) abandoned 1,000 gallon usts reportedly of uncertain age were removed from the basement of the occupied six unit residence at the site. on december 1, 2004, timothy o rourke, as property manager, notified massdep on behalf of dynamy of a release of oil to the soil in excess of reportable concentrations at the site. the notification was based on the junejuly 2004 limited subsurface investigation analytical results which were reported to dynamy on august 3, 2004. on january 4, 2005, massdep issued a notice of responsibility to tenet orourke as property manager for dynamy inc. d, timothy orourke and margaret orourke purchased the site on december 16, 2004, as recorded in the worcester district registry of deeds at book 35373page 113, on december 1, 2005, the current owner submitted to massdep a phase i completion statement and phase ii tier classification for the site. on december 23, 2005, massdep issued a notice of responsibility to respondent as property owner. be. on november 6, 2006, massdep received a ram plan submitted by respondent for the disposal site. between november 7 and 9, 2006, petroleumimpacted soil was removed from the tank grave area, the resultant excavation measured approximately 9 feet by 9 feet and extended to a depth of 5 feet below the floor grade. postexcavation field screening results indicated the presence of total volatiles in residual soils at concentrations between 37 and 94 parts per million by volume (ppmv). f, on august 13, 2008, massdep issued a to respondent, citing 310 cmr 40.0560(2), for failure to meet response action deadlines for tier ii disposal sites. specifically, massdep did not receive a phase ii comprehensive site assessment and phase iti remedial action plan within two years of tier classification. g, on september 29, 2008, onsite monitoring wells were gauged for depth to groundwater and samples were obtained from each well for analysis of eph and associated target polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) compounds. nonaqueous phase liquid (napl) at a thickness of 0.03 feet was measured in mw4, located adjacent to the front of the residence. the results of groundwater analysis for thein the matter of timothy orourke and margaret orourke acopce113a006 page 3 of 12 september 2008 sampling event identified the first occurrence of eph fractions in mw4 above applicable mcp reportable concentrations (rcgw2) standards. specifically, groundwater samples collected from mw4 in september.2008 identified eph fractions c9c18 aliphatics at 176 mgl, c19c36 aliphatics at 51 mgl, and c11c22 aromatics at 41 mgl which is above the rcgw2 standards of 5 mgl, 50 mgl, and 5 mgl respectively. fl the detection of eph fractions in groundwater and napl in mw4 during the september 29, 2008 sampling event constituted conditions requiring notification within 120 days as required by 310 cmr 40.0315(1) and (4). respondent did not notify massdep of the detection of eph fractions exceeding rcgw2, nor of the detection of napl at a thickness of equal to or greater than , inch and less than inch. failure to notify massdep of the existence of 120day notification conditions consisting of a release to the environment as indicated by the measurement of oil in groundwater in an amount equal to or greater than the applicable reportable concentration, and by the presence of a subsurface napl having a measured thickness equal to or greater than me snch and less than inch are violations of 310 cmr 40.0315(1) and 310 cmr 40.0315(4), respectively. l on november 22, 2008, an indoor air sample was collected from the release area in the basement and submitted for laboratory analysis of air petroleum hydrocarbons (aph) via massdep aph protocol. the results of november 2008 indoor air analyses indicated the presence of aph and a chlorinated volatile organic compound (cvoc) in the basement of the onsite residential building. vr the detection of aph fractions and a cvoc in indoor air during the november 22, 2008 indoor air sampling event constituted a condition requiring notification within 72, hours, as required by 310 cmr 40.0313(5). respondent did not notify massdep of the detection of aph and cvoc concentrations in indoor air at a residence. failure to notify massdep of a 72hour notification condition consisting of a condition of substantial release migration (srm) as indicated by a release to the groundwater that has resulted in the discharge of vapors into an occupied residential dwelling is a violation of 310 cmr 40.0313(5). k. the srm 72hour notification condition required an immediate response action (tra) to be conducted, as stipulated in 310 cmr 40.0412(2) and 310 cmr 40.0414(3), to eliminate andor mitigate a critical exposure pathway (cep), the route by which the vaporphase emissions of oil andor hazardous material are transported into the living or working space of the occupied residential dwelling. an ira was not conducted to eliminate andor mitigate the cep at the disposal site, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0412(2) and 310 cmr 40.0414(3). in addition, technical justification was not provided to demonstrate that the cep does not and will not, for the time period that is likely to be required for the implementation andor completion of comprehensivein the matter of timothy orourke and margaret orourke acopce113a006 page 4 of 12 response actions, present an imminent hazard and it is not feasible to eliminate or mitigate the cep as specified by 310 cmr 40.0414 (3)(a), (b) and (c). le on december 1, 2008, massdep received a combined phase ii compltion statement, phase ii completion statement, ram completion statement, and a revised tier classification submitted by respondent. the phase ii contained a screeninglevel evaluation of human health risk posed by certain volatile contaminants detected in indoor air utilizing madeps imminent hazard evaluation for rsident exposed in chemicals in indoor air short form 2006. the evaluation used exposure point concentrations (epc) equivalent to the maximum concentration of aph compounds measured in the basement indoor air which resulted in a hazard index of 1.0. naphthalene and tce were not included in the risk assessment as contaminants of concern, and a technical justification was not supplied for the omission. m. the phase ii selected method 1 as the risk characterization approach for the site based on the assumptions that impact was limited to soil and groundwater, and human receptors would potentially be exposed predominantly through contact with soil and groundwater. the phase ii inappropriately used method 1 tocharacterize riskat the disposal site, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0942(1)(b), as oil and hazardous material (i.e. aph and cvoc) were present in an environmental medium (i.e. indoor air) in addition to soil and groundwater. further, the phase ii failed to demonstrate that human receptors could potentially be exposed predominantly through contact with soil and groundwater as specified in 310 cmr 40.0942(1)(b)1., given the dwelling utilized a fieldstone foundation, and the fact that contaminated soil and groundwater were located at depth in front of the residence and below the concrete basement floor. . n, the december 2008 revised tier classification reduced the overall site numerical ranking system (nrs) score from 288 to 272, and thereby did not identify a need to change the tier classification. the revised ranking kept the indoor air exposure ., pathway rank at 100 based on the assertion that a potential exposure e pathway existed for aph fractions reported in indoor air at concentrations below the 90 percentile threshold values of typical indoor air concentrations for the reported compounds. in fact, the results of november 2008 indoor air analyses indicated the presence of aph and a chlorinated volatile organic compound (cvoc) in the basement at concentrations above the threshold values at which multiple lines of evidence are required as provided in table 1 of madeps indoor air threshold values for the evaluation of a vapor intrusion pathway draft technical update policy 08xxx, madep, june 26, 2008. the following, compounds exceeded the thresholds identified in table 1 cscg aromatics at 110 ugm, cocj2 aliphatics at 160 ugm, and oe ci0 aromatics at 23 ugm. further, the detection limit of naphthalene at 2.0 ugm and detection of a cvoc, trichloroethylene (tce), at 22 ugm also exceeded respective thresholds. despite exceeding thresholds, an evaluation utilizing multiple lines of evidence was not provided to demonstrate that a vapor intrusion pathway did not exist.in the matter of timothy orourke and margaret orourke acopce113a006 page 5 of 12 the nrs revision failed to identify a confirmed exposure pathway and assign a value of 200 to the indoor air confirmed pathway as substantiated by the existence of aph and cvoc above background, in violation of 310 cmr 40.1512(4). in addition, a tier i permit was not submitted to massdep within 60 days of rescoring, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0530(2), and work at the disposal site progressed without a tier i permit, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0702(4). , o. on february 17, 2009, massdep received a phase iv remedy implementation plan (rip). the rip presented a schedule for implementing the selected remedial alternative which called for monthly enhanced fluid recovery (efr) events, and quarterly groundwater and indoor air sampling to begin in march 2009. the initial efr and monitoring frequency would continue for the first six months, with subsequent activities consisting of efr events as necessary, and long term quarterly monitoring until a class c response action outcome (rao), at a minimum, is achieved. in addition, the february 2009 phase iv rip did not contain a health and safety plan, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0874(3) (). p. general provisions for phase iv response actions were not met at the disposal site, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0871(6), as the phased iv implementation did not conform to the proposals and specifications contained in the rip one efr event was conducted on august 25, 2009, and groundwaterindoor air was last monitored prior to the phase iv rip. in addition, phase iv status reports addressing a srm condition have not been submitted monthly, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0877(1) (a). q. on august 25, 2009, massdep conducted an audit inspection at the disposal site. r. on june 1, 2020, massdep issued a notice of enforcement conference and conducted an enforcement conference

massdep received a release notification form with a 120day notification for a release of extractable petroleum hydrocarbons (eph) detected in groundwater exceeding reportable concentrations. massdep issued a notice of responsibility to respondent on august 1, 2008 and assigned the site release tracking number (rtn) 20017140. the site was classified as a tier ii disposal site on july 15, 2009. therefore, pursuant to the requirements of the mcp, the phase ii comprehensive site assessment and phase hi remedial action plan were due two years later, by july 15, 2011. to date, the respondent has not submitted the phase i and iii phase iii documents, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0560(2). b. on december 20, 2013, respondent submitted a class a3 response action outcome (rao) statement to massdep and a revised rao on december 31, 2013.. on february 10, 2014, massdep initiated a comprehensive audit of respondents response actions under , including the rao submittals. according to the rao, the respondent allows motor vehicle repair and maintenance activities at the site. in the rao, respondent identified the presence of an active catch basindrywell located inside the vehicle maintenance bays at the facility. the catch basindrywell consisted of concrete block construction, with a paver stone bottom, which was installed circa 1975 when the building was erected. respondent concluded that the catch basin was selfleaching and is not connected to an oilwater separator or tight tank to prevent the waste oil and motor vehicle runoff from discharging into the environment. respondent did not propose or complete any required connections to rectify this situation, despite the ongoing discharge from this structure. the site inspection by massdep on february 28, 2014, confirmed the continued maintenance, operation, and leaching of the catch basindrywell, which constitutes the impermissible operation of a motor vehicle waste disposal well, in violation of 310 cmr 27.04(5). c. respondents failure to cease the direct discharge to the catch basindrywell is also a violation of 310 cmr 40.1003(a)5, which states that an rao cannot be achieved until each source of oil andor hazardous materials is eliminated or controlled. d. respondent failed to submit a risk characterization in support of the class a3 rao meeting the minimum requirements for either a method 1 or method 3 risk characterization, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0941(3). the method 1 risk characterization submitted by the respondent included method 3type risk characterization tables (tables 6, 7, 8), which

in paragraphs 3 and 8 by adding additional language, including referencing inaccurate book and page number for the property deed (ii) throughout form 1075 the respondent inconsistently applied the terms of property and portion of property, in violation of 310 cmr 40.1074(1). the aul was also deficient in the following respects (i) it contained an inaccurate reference to a survey plan (ii) it failed to provide clear descriptions of consistent and inconsistent activities and uses, and obligations and conditions and (iii) the required aul form 1075 was not stamped by an lsp, all in violation of 310 cmr 40.1074(2). the descriptions of activities and uses consistent with the aul opinion, activities and uses inconsistent with the aul opinion, and obligations and conditions set forth in the

(gec) advanced soil borings at the site and identified metals (antimony, cadmium, chromium, lead and nickel) in soil at levels that exceeded the rcs1 reportable concentrations of the mcp. gec detected total chromium at a concentration of 500 mgkg in one sample (b13) collected from a depth of 03 feet. below the ground surface. this condition met the criteria for a release that could pose a potential imminent hazard (ih). 310 cmr 40.0321(2)(b) provides, in part, that a release to the environment indicated by the measurement of concentrations of hexavalent chromium (or total chromium in the absence of hexavalent chromium data) equal to or greater than 200 mgkg within a depth of twelve inches below the ground surface at any location within 500 feet of a residential dwelling, could pose an imminent hazard to human health unless access by children is controlled or prevented by means of bituminous pavement, concrete, fence, or other physical barrier. b. respondent obtained knowledge of the potential ih release condition on or about july 7, 2011, when gec transmitted to respondent an electronic copy of the analytical summary tables and a site sketch showing the sample locations. respondent was required to notify massdep of the potential ih condition within two hours of knowledge, but failed to do so. respondents failure to notify massdep constitutes a violation of 310 cmr 40.0311(7) which provides, in part, that persons required to notify under 310 cmr 40,0331 shall notify the department not more than two hours after obtaining knowledge of any release of any oil andor

inc., on behalf of respondent, conducted further assessment to confirm gecs findings. soil samples from 13 borings advanced at the site and abutting property showed similar metals and concentrations within the top five feet of fill, which was consistent with gecs findings. however, no samples were collected from the area where the elevated chromium level had been reported previously by gec. while respondent was required to evaluate the site conditions to determine whether a potential jh or other immediate response action (ira) condition was present at the site, respondent failed to do so. this failure violated 310 cmr 40.0411(7), which provides, in part, that prps shall continually assess and evaluate release and site conditions in order to determine if an ira is required. d. on november 11, 2011, respondent submitted a release notification form (rnf) to massdep for a 120day release notification condition. the rnf identified antimony, cadmium, chromium, lead and nickel in soil above the applicable rcs1 reportable concentrations. massdep assigned rtn 218412 to this release. on november 14, 2012, massdep received a tier ii classification submittal prepared by geoinsight, inc. the submittal included the analytical results reported by gec in june 2011 as well as thein the matter of parks cramer lofts, llc acopce133r008 page 3 of 9 data subsequently collected by geolnsight in october 2011. the submittal characterized the site as a vacant, unpaved lot. e. on november 1419, 2012, respondent regraded and paved the disposal site. the paving was designed by geoinsight as an engineered barrier to eliminate the soil exposure pathway and thereby achieve a response action outcome (rao). the work included the removal and relocation of surficial topsoil from the north portion of the site to the southwest corner and along the northern border installation of a new drainage line and catch basin incorporating the excess fill from the catch basin into the new subgrade installation of 812 inches of structural gravel base course installation of two inches of asphalt binder pavement and installation of 2436 inches of final coverin unpaved areas. reportedly, no contaminated soil was removed from the site during the work. the excavation and onsite reuse of contaminated soil, and the construction of an engineered barrier were mcp response actions that required the submittal of a release abatement measure (ram) plan. respondents failure to submit a ram plan prior to the initiation of this work was in violation of 310 cmr 40.0443(1), which provides, in part, that a ram shall not be conducted at any disposal site until a complete release abatement measure plan, as described in 310 cmr 40.0444, has been received by massdep. f. respondent did not provide the abutting property owner with a notice of environmental sampling for the samples collected in october 2011 on the abutting property until january 18, 2013. respondents failure to timely notify the abutting property owner was in violation of 310 cmr 40.1403(10), which provides, in part, that any time environmental samples are taken at a property on behalf of someone other than the owner of the property, the persons conducting the response actions shall, within 30 days of the date the sample results are issued by the laboratory, provide the property owner with the results of the sample analyses of samples from the property owners property and a written notice that additional documentation associated with the samples will be provided to the property owner within 30 days of receipt of a request for such documentation. g. massdep conducted a level 2 audit inspection on december 26, 2012. massdep confirmed that the area of boring b13, where the chromium was detected by gec in surface soil, was not fenced or paved, and observed that the abutting residential property owner had erected a fence and installed turf within this area of the site. after the inspection, massdep contacted the lsp of record to discuss the site conditions. the lsp immediately provided notification of a release that could pose an imminent hazard and proposed a verbal immediate response action (ira) plan. massdep assigned rtn 218777 to this release. respondent installed a fence and initiated an imminent hazard evaluation within 14 days of notification. in a february 25, 2013 imminent hazard evaluation

obtain approval for a significant modification to an immediate response action (tra). on february 7, 1996, an ira plan was received by the department that specified collection of fuel oil nonaqueous phase liquid (napl) using a pneumatic skimmer. the napl recovery system was orally approved by the department on march 18, 1996. the napl recovery system was activated on april 1, 1996. thecatholic charities, 210720211029 2 administrative consent order wpenalty 15 ripley st., worcester acopce053a014 ira completion statement received by the department on june 20, 2001, indicated that operation of the recovery system was shut down some time in mid1999, no exact date was provided. technical justification for deactivation prior to implementation of comprehensive response actions was not provided in the ira completion statement. deactivation of the napl recovery system constitutes a significant modification to the ira. an ira plan modification was not submitted to the department prior to deactivating the approved skimmer pump. deactivation of the recovery system was not approved by the department, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0420(6). b. failure to stabilize site conditions prior to submitting an immediate response action completion statement. the pneumatic bailing system that was approved as an ira to reduce the level of napl in monitoring wells at the site was discontinued in mid1999. thicknesses of napl found to be present within monitoring well cee1 had ranged from 3.34 feet in october 1997 to 23.99 feet in march 1998. napl thickness since deactivation in 1999 has ranged from 5.35 feet in june 2001 to 18.85 feet in may 2003. passive bailing, conducted as a comprehensive response action, was not initiated until february 2001. an ira completion statement was received by the department on june 20, 2001. levels of napl increased after the recovery system was shut down and passive bailing was initiated as a comprehensive response action. therefore, the ira completion statement was submitted before the site conditions giving rise to the ira were stabilized, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0427(1)(a). c. failure to reclassify a disposal site. the site was classified as tier h in 1996 with a numerical ranking system (nrs) score of 263. borings advanced and monitoring wells installed in 1998 revealed the presence of napl six inches below the boiler roommaintenance office. air monitoring results from samples collected in october 1999 within the onsite residential building contained petroleum hydrocarbons above background concentrations. detected indoor air concentrations above background levels are considered a likely or confirmed exposure pathway, which would change the numerical ranking system score to 363, exceeding the tier ic threshold score of 350. additionally, oil or hazardous materials (ohm) toxicity scores were incorrectly based on dissolved concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons in groundwater rather than napl. a revised nrs scoresheet and a tier i permit application was not submitted to the department, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0530(1).catholic charities, 210720211029 3 administrative consent order wpenalty 15 ripley st., worcester acopce053a014 d. failure to meet phase iii performance standards. a phase iit remedial action plan (rap) was received by the department on february 17, 2000. the phase hi considers three remedial alternatives as technically feasible (1) soil excavation for source removal of subsurface petroleum (2) high vacuum extraction (hve) of liquid phase petroleum and (3) collection of oil with passive diffusion bailers. boring logs indicate that as many as 75 blows were required to advance a split spoon soil collector six inches. test pit logs uniformly indicate that soils consisted of fine grain sand and clay and are described as dense, which is typically considered less conducive to passive recovery than hve or soil excavation. passive recovery was selected based upon the relative cost in comparison with hve and soil excavation. the phase iii rap states, alternative 1 (passive recovery) would attain a temporary solution relatively rapidly (ic. within six months). on the other hand, product recovery would likely be ongoing for decades. the other two alternatives were reported to take from six months to three years to achieve a permanent solution. in addition, the report acknowledges that passive recovery posed higher future exposure risk. the phase iii rap estimated approximately 2,500 gallons of fuel oil product to be located within a limited area of approximately 11,250 square feet. the phase iii cost estimate table estimates that approximately 400 gallons of product could be removed from the subsurface annually with passive recovery. between august 2002 and june 2003, the passive bailers recovered 3.53 gallons. approximately 540 gallons of oil and water were collected via the pneumatic skimmer pump utilized during ira activities from april 1996 to 1999. the phase iii rap failed to select an effective remedial alternative that is reasonably likely to achieve a level of no significant risk in a timely manner taking into consideration site characteristics in comparison to other feasible technologies, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0853. e. failure to meet class c response action outcome requirements. the class c response action outcome (rao) statement described only operation of the passive recovery system (temporary solution) in the portion devoted to achieving a permanent solution. at the passive napl recovery rate of less than 5 gallonsyear, it would take more than 500 years to remove the estimated volume of oil product in the subsurface environment. a section of the rao is entitled steps toward a permanent solution. however, no definitive and enterprising steps were described, such as contingencies if remedial goals (e.g. product recovery estimates) were not met, in violation of 310 cmr 40.01050(5)(a).catholic charities,

conducted to evaluate the feasibility of manual bailing and vacuum extraction. the pilot tests demonstrated manual bailing to be effective to reduce and maintain napl thicknesses. on november 10, 2004, the department received a periodic evaluation of the temporary solution recommending continued manual bailing at a frequency of an approximately threeweek basis to allow a recoverable amount of napl to accumulate at thicknesses of approximately 1.5 ft. in monitoring wells cee1 and cee2 and 0.25 ft. in monitoring well gza5. 5. the parties have agreed to enter into this consent order because

consent order exxonmobil is a responsible party under the mcp for the performance of response actions at the site. , a. on july 26, 1989, the department was notified of the discovery of a release of petroleum hydrocarbons at the former exxonmobilmarlco bulk fuel storage facility located at 279 maple street in marlborough, massachusetts. the notification was made by the existing owner at that time, 279 maple street realty trust. b. the department issued notices of responsibility (nor) to 279 maple street trust (the trust) of wellesley, massachusetts, and mobil oil corporation of fairfax, virginia, on may 30, 1990, and june 26, 1990, respectively. in addition to notifying mobil and trust of their liability for the reported release, the department requested implementation of a short term measure (stm) to abate a condition that is considered an imminent hazard. the norstm cited the presence of separatephase petroleum product (identified as light fuel oil) on ground water at the site as a condition that the department considered an imminent hazard under the mcp in effect at that time. c. on october 10, 1990, the department granted approval to the trust to operate a ground water depression and petroleum product recovery system as a stm. the product and ground water recovertreatment system began operation at the site during 1990. approximately 289 tons of petroleum

priority disposal site. f. on march 18, 1994, the department issued a tier ib permit (848920) to exxon mobil. the tier ib permit was accepted by exxonmobil on march 30, 1994, failure to operate ira remedial system intended to abate separatephase product and an imminent hazard g. on august 11, 1994, in response to exxonmobils july 1994 release abatement measure (ram) plan submittal, the department issued a letter to exxonmobil requesting submission of an immediate response action (ira) plan to modify the existing stm system in operation at the site. on august 30, 1994, the department received a plan for an immediate response action (ira). the ira plan consisted of the same work plan as the previously submitted ram plan, with only a name modification. the ira plan stipulated continued operation of the ground water product recovery system at the site. the department issued a written conditional approval for the ira on september 14, 1994, requiring that exxonmobil must . comply with all requirements of the october 10, 1990 stm approval. the department has received ira status reports since the written ira approval. the ira status reports document the implementation and course of ira activities conducted at the site to date to abate an imminent hazard posed by the presence of separatephase petroleum product at the site. in accordance with the plans submitted by exxonmobil, the recovery system consists of two separate systems an interceptor trench (trench system), and a total fluid recovery system near and under the building (building system). as reported in the ira status reports, the trench system was not operational between november 1997 and october 1998 due to maintenance issues, and the building system has been inoperable since november 1997 due to repair issues with the programmable logic controller (plc), the department considers the failure to operate the remedial system in light of the continued presence of separatephase product and a condition constituting an imminent hazard to be a violation of 310 cmr 40.0420 and the department stmira approvals of october 10, 1990 and september 14, 1994. h. in various ira status reports submitted to the department, exxonmobil indicated the operational status of the recovery systems. according to those ira status reports, the trench system and the building system were operational through april 1997, but were inoperable due to mechanical difficulties and faulty control equipment from april to july 1997, at which time the systems were restarted. theexxonmobil corporation rtn

the. water lines had frozen. during the subsequent operation and maintenance (om) visit in april 1998, the recovery trench lines were found to be blocked with bacterial and iron fouling and required replacement the lines were replaced in october 1998, and the trench.system was started ten (10) days thereafter. no separate phase hydrocarbon (sph) was observed to exist in the trench system since september 1996, and consequently, the trench system was not recovering sph. the building system was inoperable from november 1997 through december 1999 due to a faulty plc that had been electrically damaged, apparently by the lightning strike that erased the program plc systems. although not elaborated on in ira status reports, exxonmobil undertook troubleshooting activities and attempts to locate a programmer to repair the plc from the time it was found to be inoperable. although one or both recovery systems were inoperable for periods of time, the sph plume decreased between 1994 and 1999. i. on march 6, 1996, the department received a phase ii scope of work. j. on may 30, 1996, the department received the phase ii comprehensive site assessment (phase ii report). the phase ii report identifies former above ground petroleum storage tanks (asts), a former petroleum underground storage tank (ust) and associated distribution pipeline as sources of petroleum contamination at the site. contaminants at the site consist of sph that had been analyzed as weathered no. 2 distillate of oil with a minor component of weathered gasoline, as well as dissolvedphase and adsorbedphase petroleum hydrocarbons. in addition, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) have been identified in soil and ground water samples from the site. contamination at the site exists primarily southeast of the former asts and in the vicinity of the former ust. ground water flow at the site is generally to the southeast, discharging to the abutting wetlands and pond. unconsolidated materials at the site consist of a sandcobble layer from the surface to a depth of approximately two to six feet below grade, followed by a one to three feet thick organic peat layer, underlain by a sand layer. k. on january 5, 2001, exxonmobil requested permission to shut down the remedial system due to electrical problems within the building, and to keep the system off until the remediation system is upgraded as

led massdfp to issue this consent order a. on august 24, 1989, massdep was notified by the worcester department of public health and code enforcement (dphce) that a release of petroleum impacted mill brook. worcester dphce identified the contamination as having originated ftom behind the subject property. massdep issued a notice of responsibility on the same day to mr. dennis smith of lindberg heat treating co. for the release of 250 gallons of quench oil. the release resulted from a holding tank overfill and impacted the parking lot, a storm drain, and mill brook. b. on july 23, 1991, massdep received correspondence from mr. dennis smith of lindberg heat treating co. notifying massdep of the detection of unspecified petroleum hydrocarbons in soil samples taken from the subject property. the sampling was conducted during the closure and abandonment of two fuel oil tanks beneath a building at the subject property. c. on august 19, 1998, massdep was notified by the worcester dphce that a release of petroleum impacted mill brook, and identified the contamination as having originated from behind the subject property. an oil fingerprint analysis confirmed the presence of 6 fuel oil in mill brook. massdep issued a notice of responsibility on september 29, 1998, to mr. martin lee of lindberg heat treating co. for the release of 6 fuel oil emanating from the lindberg property and impacting mill brook. d. on november 2, 1998, massdep received correspondence from mr. stephen sakakenny, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering on behalf of lindberg heat treating co. notifying massdep of the intent to evaluate evidence of oil contamination to determine if a notification condition exists pursuant to the mcp. on december 8, 1998, capaccio employed an oil fingerprint analysis of a grab sample from the mill brook culvert which identified 2 fuel oil as having emanated from the site. e. on march 15, 1999, massdep issued a notice of responsibility (nor) to mr. martin lee of lindberg heat treating co. for the release of oil to the soil andor groundwater at the subject property, and massdep assigned release tracking number 20012660 to the disposal site. the nor cited the july 23, 1991 correspondence identifying petroleum hydrocarbons in soils at the site, and the august 19, 1998 occurrence of 6 fuel oil in mill brook as evidence that a release of oil has occurred at the site and a condition of substantial release migration (srm) may be present. the nor required evaluation of notification conditions and, at a minimum, formal notification of a release of oil to the soil by april 15, 1999. f. on march 19, 1999, mr. sakakenny verbally notified massdep that a release of 6 fuel oil to a storm drain occurred at the site as evidenced by oil having impacted the mill brook culvert. during the march 19, 1999 verbal notification mr. sakakenny stated that no srm condition was present as the opening to the culvert was plugged and oil wasin the matter of bodycote thermal processing, inc. acopce103a008 page 3 of 14 not presently entering the culvert. mr. sakakenny subsequently amended the notification on february 14, 2000, indicating 2 fuel

contamination as an abandoned in place 3,000 gallon 2 fuel oil tank referred to in the aforementioned july 23, 1991 lindberg heat treating correspondence. g. respondent conducted response actions under beginning with an immediate response action (ira) on march 19, 1999. a biological degradation enhancing treatment system with integrated nonaqueous phase liquid (napl) recovery was proposed as an immediate response action on november 3, 2000. massdep issued a written approval letter for the plan on december 21, 2000. further assessment activities included soil and groundwater sampling, and water table gauging. h. respondents comprehensive response action implemented to achieve a permanent solution at the disposal site consists of a napl recovery and insitu biological treatment system. groundwater is extracted from a recovery trench, napl separated from the groundwater in fractionating drums, and the groundwater is treated with nutrients prior to discharge in an onsite recharge trench. 1, the groundwater treatment system removes napl from the extracted groundwater by fractionating the napl in three open drums connected in series which reside in a treatment shed. treatment system maintenance personnel remove napl floating in the fractionation drums by applying hydrophobic petroleum absorbent pads to the napl and collecting the petroleum saturated pads in a fivegallon pail. the napl and contaminated media are transported to a hazardous waste accumulation area in the fivegallon collection pail and handled with the facility hazardous waste stream in accordance with 310 cmr 30.0000. j. on july 30, 2008, massdep conducted an audit inspection of response actions at the site. k. subsequent to the july 30, 2008 site inspection, massdep issued a request for

inc. acopce103a008 page 4 of 14 m. during the july 30, 2008 site inspection, massdep staff identified several violations of the management procedures for remediation waste at the site 1) the fivegallon remediation waste collection pail was not labeled in accordance with 310 cmr 40.0031(1) and 310 cmr 30.682. 2) the fivegallon remediation waste collection pail lacked a cover and contained remediation waste from previous napl removal events. the remediation waste container was not kept closed during storage of the remediation waste from previous events, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0031(1) and 310 cmr 30.685(1). 3) as the remediation waste container lacked a cover, the container could not be sealed prior to transfer to the accumulation area, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0031(1) and 310 cmr 30.685(1). 4) the remediation waste collection pail which contained remediation waste from previous napl removal events was stored in an accumulation area located in the treatment shed which was not posted with signage as required by 310 cmr 40.0031(1) and 40.0036(1), 310 cmr 30.341(4) and 30.253(6). 5) the remediation waste accumulation area located in the treatment shed was not clearly marked with fencing, gate or tape to clearly distinguish it from areas where wastes are not stored, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0031(1) and 40.0036(1), and 310 cmr 30.341(5). n. during the july 30, 2008 site inspection, massdep audit staff noted the onsite inspection log to be in poor condition and contained gaps in inspection and maintenance from february to july, 2008. the september 19, 2008 capaccio rfi response included inspection notes taken by an alternate site technician who logged the site visit information in an offsite log and omitted recording information in the onsite log from february to july 2008. failure to keep maintenance and inspection log books and records in the available secure onsite building is a violation of 310 cmr 40.0041(6)(d). o. the september 19, 2008 rfi response did not provide requested information documenting a final electrical inspection for the construction of the treatment shed and associated wiring for the groundwater treatment system. failure to obtain a building permit and associated inspection from the city of worcester code inspection department constitutes failure to construct and install such works in a manner adequate to protect health, safety, public welfare, and the environment, and in compliance with m.g.l. c. 21e and 310 cmr 40.0000 and is therefore a violation of 310 cmr 40.0041(5). pe question one of the massdep

rfi response summary of all groundwater treatment system operational and field data failed to demonstrate that a certified operator had inspected the system at regular intervals of three months for the duration of the discharge, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0041(9). q. massdep received a supplemental rfi response, dated november 12, 2008, prepared by dawn horter, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc. the supplemental rfi response states that as of may 2001, capaccio staff determined 310 cmr 40.0041(9), which requires quarterly wwto inspections, was not applicable as the system meets the exemption outlined as being a discharge of remedial additives. the response states further that voluntary site inspection of the remedial system will be conducted by capaccio on a periodic basis, and the inspections were initiated during november 2008. subsequent to the audit inspection, massdep determined that the groundwater treatment system removing napl from the extracted groundwater prior to treatment with nutrients and discharge does not meet the aforementioned exemption. therefore, respondent was required to perform quarterly wwto inspections, and the failure to do so is in violation of 310 cmr 40.0041(9). r, massdep received a phase iii report, dated july 2002, which was prepared by stephen sakakeeny, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc. figures 4 and 5 of the phase iti depict a planar layout view of the groundwater extraction and recharge galleries, and a planar cross sectional view of the petroleum release conceptual model respectively. taken together, the figures show groundwater extraction and recharge occur downgradient of the source identified as an abandoned in place 3,000 gallon 2 fuel oil tank, located under the southern portion of the east end of the facility building. with the exception of one report, all groundwater contour maps included in remedy operation status reports, received by massdep since august 2004, depict groundwater mounding centered at the recharge gallery downgradient of the source. the groundwater mounding depicted in the groundwater contour maps show groundwater flow radially from the recharge area sufficient to effectively limit treatment and hydraulic containment to the contaminated area downgradient from the identified source and upgradient from the extraction gallery. s. the documented consistent gradient reversal at the east end of the source area demonstrates a negative impact on efforts to recover napl emanating from the source. the groundwater mound exhibits significant lateral gradient away from the extraction gallery indicating hydraulic containment of the groundwater at the disposal site is not maintained so that the remedial wastewater discharged upgradient of the point of withdrawal has not been contained or recaptured within the boundaries of the disposal site as required by 310 cmr 40.0045(4)(a). inducing a gradient away from thein the matter of bodycote thermal processing, inc. acopce103a008 page 6 of 14 extraction gallery initiated contaminant transport across the disposal site, thereby exacerbating site conditions and impairing the performance of the treatment system, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0045(4)(d) and as evidenced by napl migration to mw9, formerly upgradient of the source. t. dawn horter, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc. verbally notified massdep at 1240 p.m. on may 5, 2005, of the presence of greater than inch of subsurface napl in mw9 from a source other than the known abandoned 3,000 gallon 2 fuel oil tank. massdep received an ira plan dated july 7, 2005 prepared by dawn horter, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc. the ira plan referred to verbal notification from worldwide geosciences, inc. of houston, texas that a comparison of napl samples from mws4, mws7 and mw11 taken in 2002 with a napl sample from mw9 taken in 2005 indicated the 2002 and 2005 samples were unrelated. u copies of worldwide geosciences, inc. characterization of product sample reports, dated june 2005 and february 2003, respectively, were received by massdep on march 4, 2009. the february 2003 report characterized samples from the treatment system and two monitoring wells (mws7, mws11) as consistent with severely biodegraded residual fuel oils (5, 6) as the parent product. the sample from the other monitoring well (mws4) was characterized as consistent with a mixture of 2 grade fuel oil, and either an intermediate grade (4). or residual grade (5, 6) fuel oil. the report further states the level.of biodegradation for all the four site samples indicates most probable exposure times of twenty years or more. v. the june 2005 worldwide geosciences report indicates a sample from mw9 was a severely biodegraded diesel2 fuel oil product with a probable exposure time of twenty years or more. in addition, the 2005 report states that if 2 grade fuel oil is a component of mws4 sample, the 2 fuel oil is a different 2 fuel oil than the 2 dieselfuel product associated with the current mw9 sample. the report further identifies the samples from the treatment system, mws7, and mws11 as consisting predominately of hydrocarbons that are heavier than the hydrocarbons associated with the mw9 sample (diesel2 fuel oil product). w. massdep has reviewed the june 2005 and february 2003 worldwide geosciences, inc. reports and has determined that the reports do not provide sufficient technical justification to demonstrate napl in mw9 has emanated from another source given the proximity to the identified source, gradient relative to the source, and the fact that napl from mw9 has been characterized as the same type and weathered age as product specified for the abandoned 3,000 gallon 2 fuel oil tank. x. the worldwide geosciences, inc. characterization of product sample reports, dated june 2005 and february 2003, indicate the existence of contaminant sources other than the identified 3,000 gallon 2 fuel oil tank. the june 2005 report characterizes thein the matter of bodycote thermal processing, inc. acopce103a008 page 7 of 14 treatment system napl sample as consisting predominately of hydrocarbons other than diesel range organics, thereby demonstrating the product recovered by the treatment system since october 2002 has predominantly consisted of a petroleum product other than 2 fuel oil. the conclusions presented in the characterization of product sample reports were of such import that it was necessary to provide additional information to the phase ii report, dated may 24, 2002, prepared by stephen sakakeeny, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc., as required by 310 cmr 40.0835(4), to adequately characterize the disposal site consistent with the response action performance standard described in 310 cmr 40.0191. respondents failure to provide the additional information to the phase ii report is a violation of 310 cmr 40.0835(4). in addition, the may 24, 2002 phase ii report fails to comply with the performance standards for a phase ii report required by 310 cmr 40.0833 (1)(a), by failing to adequately develop and evaluate sufficient information to support conclusions and opinions regarding the source, nature, extent, and potential impacts of releases of oil andor hazardous material. y. massdep received an ira completion report, phase iv remedy implementation plan (rip), and final inspection report dated march 18, 2003, which was prepared by stephen sakakeeny, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc. the phase iv rip did not include a health and safety plan to be followed during the implementation of the comprehensive remedial action, and did not list the requisite building permits, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0874(3) (e) (f) respectively. zl. section 3.2 of the march 2003 rip, construction plans, engineering design and specifications, specified the dimension, size and capacity of treatment system components. the rip did not provide significant changes andor new information related to disposal site conditions, nor did the rip provide relevant design operational parameters, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0874 (3) (b) (2) (6). specifically, the rip omitted significant new information identified in the february 2003 characterization of product sample reports. in addition, the rip did not provide design calculations to determine the dimension, size and capacity of treatment system components expected treatment, destruction, immobilization or containment efficiencies and documentation of how that degree of effectiveness was determined. aa. question 6, of the august 26, 2008 massdep rfi, requested a chronological list of all instances where the treatment system was not operational for a period of seven consecutive days. the capaccio rfi response, dated september 29, 2008, listed 67 instances during the time period from january 19, 2005 through may 1, 2008, where the treatment system was not operational upon arrival of terrane remediation staff for the weekly maintenance visit due to various reasons. these aforementioned outages do not include an extended outage which purportedly occurred during a 48 day period from february 8, 2008 to march 27, 2008, reported in the remedy operating status (ros) inspection and monitoring report dated july 21, 2008, prepared by dawn horter, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc.in the matter of bodycote thermal processing, inc. acopce103a008 page 8 of 14 bb. with the exception of the ros inspection and monitoring report, dated july 21, 2008, ros inspection and monitoring reports, received by massdep reporting operational conditions since january 2005, characterized the bioremediation system as . operating continuously, and failed to report the 67 instances during the time period from january 19, 2005 through may 1, 2008, where the treatment system was not operational upon arrival of terrane remediation staff for the weekly maintenance. respondents failure to report the system failures for more than 18 days on average without an outage over a 3.5 year period constitutes a failure to describe conditions or problems noted during the reporting period that are or may be affecting the performance of the remedial action, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0892(2)(c). cc. failure to provide hydraulic containment of remedial wastewater discharged upgradient of the point of withdrawal to ensure containment or recapture within the boundaries of the disposal site and to not exacerbate existing conditions or impair the performance of remedial actions, combined with operating the treatment system without obtaining a building permit and associated inspection from the city of worcester code inspection department, demonstrates that the performance standard for remedy operating status has not been met. specifically, the remedial system has not been adequately designed in accordance with 310 cmr 40.0870 to achieve a permanent solution the remedial system has not been operated and maintained in accordance with applicable permits and approvals and, the source of oil andor hazardous material has not been controlled in accordance with 310 cmr 40. 100365), in violation of 310 cmr 40.0893 (2) (b), (c), (d). dd. the ros inspection and monitoring report, dated july 21, 2008, prepared by dawn horter, lsp, of capaccio environmental engineering, inc. noted an outage which occurred during a 48 day period from february 8, 2008 to march 27, 2008. the treatment system was not operational due to a frozen infiltration line. a review of the remedial system log provided within the capaccio rfi response, dated september 29, 2008, indicates the system status was identified as nonoperational during the treatment system inspection on february 15, 2008, and the system was successfully restarted during the treatment system inspection on april 10, 2008, indicating the system was inoperable for 62 days. written notice of a mechanical failure was not submitted to massdep within 30 days of obtaining such knowledge, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0893 (6)

space age electronics states that definitive and enterprising steps to be taken toward . achievement of a permanent solution, in pertinent part, requires obtaining samples from monitoring wells twice yearly, samples must be analyzed for vph, eph, and target analytes of concern as identified in the rao. respondents contractor, madison construction, destroyed the sites monitoring wells during its

the property was listed in 1988 for a release of gasoline to soil and groundwater. the prior owner did not complete the necessary response actions. respondent purchased it on august 1, 2003 with the plan of developing the property into a donut shop. b. on march 9, 2004, respondent entered into an administrative consent order (aco) with massdep, establishing timelines for completion of the necessary assessment and cleanup of the site. the aco was extended twice in amendments executed on january 25, 2005 and december 15, 2005. a third amendment was requested and denied by massdep in a letter dated march 29, 2006. in that letter, massdep stated that although the aco would not be amended, massdep would not pursue enforcement if respondent submitted a phase tv remedy implementation plan (rip), phase iv completion statement, and either a remedy operation status (ros) opinion or response action outcome statement (rao) by april 28, 2006. c, on may 19, 2006, respondent submitted a phase iv rip and ros opinion. the submittals proposed to remediate the gasoline release at the property through the implementation of monitored natural attenuation (mna). massdep audited the submittals and identified the following violations . i. pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0191(2), response actions shall consider relevant policies and guidelines issued by massdep and usepa, and shall use practices that are appropriate and generally accepted by the professional community. the proposal for mna does not comply with this requirement because, among other things, respondent has failed to delineate the extent of contamination, respondent has not established that the plume is stable or shrinking, and respondents sampling locations, frequency and analytical parameters are inconsistant with published mna guidance of massdep, usepa, andor american society for testing and materials (astm). in addition, 310 cmr 40.0191(3) requires that where feasible, technologies be considered that resuse, recycle, detoxify or treat the contaminants. groundwater has not been sampled for geochemical parameters to demonstrate that natural attenuation is occuring as a destructive process. respondent has therefore violated 310 cmr 40.0191(2) and (3). ii. pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0893(2), the remedial program established under ros shall be adequately designed to achieve a permanent solution, each source of contamination shall be eliminated and controlled, and any substantial hazard shall be eliminated. as described above, the proposed remedy does not comply with multiple published guidance documents and there is inadequate information to conclude that it would achieve a permanent solution. in addition, without full delineation of the release it is inappropriate to conclude that no substantial hazard exists. finally, the proposed remedy relies on excavation of source area soil, which respondent has failed to conduct. therefore, an uncontrolled source may still be present at the site. therefore, respondent has violated 310 cmr 40.0893(2).in the matter of emerald realty trust acopce093 a003 page 3 of 10 iii, pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0874(3), a phase iv rip must include an operation, maintenance, and monitoring (omm) plan and a health and safety plan. the rip erroneously states that these items are not required. while the rip does propose limited monitoring, the monitoring, as described above, does not comply with published guidance for mna and is not adequately protective for potential indoor air impacts at downgradient residences. therefore, respondent has violated 310 cmr 40.0874(3). . iv. pursuant to 310 cmr 40.0879(1), respondent must submit a phase iv completion statement upon completion of the phase iv activities and prior to submission of a ros opinion. in addition, the phase iv completion statement was required by a prior aco issued by massdep to respondent. respondent remains in violation of these requirements by failing to submit the phase v completion statement. v. the may 19, 2006 submittal did not contain copies or other documentation that the required notice had been provided to the chief municipal officer and board of health, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0880(1) and 310 cmr 40.1403(3). d. respondent received a (non) on october 16, 2006, describing the violations listed above. the non requested a revised submittal within 180 days of the non, or by april 14, 2007. respondent failed to return to compliance in response to the non. , e. subsequent to the issuance of the non, massdep identified an additional violation for related release tracking number (rtn) 20015270. this rtn is associated with gasoline contamination in shallow groundwater adjacent to a downgradient residence. respondents assessment conducted in response to.this condition confirmed the presence of low concentrations of siterelated contamination in the residential indoor air. laboratory analyses of the most recent samples collected in february 2006 did not detect contamination in the indoor air. this assessment is documented in the ros submittal. because the condition is a 2hour notification condition, the assessment was initiated as an immediate response action (ira). an ira plan was submitted in october 2004 and a singie ira status report was submitted on february 8, 2005. however, 310 cmr 40.0425(2) requires the submittal of ira status reports every six months until an ira completion statement is filed. by failing to file the ira completion statement or ira status reports, respondent has violated 310 cmr 40.0425(2). f, on october 2, 2007, massdep personnel observed the excavation of utility trenches at the site in the area of the former underground storage tanks and pump islands that have been identified as the source of petroleum contamination at the site. massdep contacted respondents licensed site professional (lsp), who was unaware of the excavation work. g. on october 3, 2007, massdep personnel conducted a site inspection, and observed utility trenching in relation to the documented contamination at the site.in the matter of emerald realty trust acopce093a003 page 4 of 10 h. therefore, massdep determines that, in addition to the previouslyidentified violations, respondent conducted a uram without the required notice to massdep, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0462(1)(b). i. on october 19, 2007, respondent submitted a proposal for returning the site to compliance. respondent proposed to install and sample additional monitoring wells on the property. respondent proposed to employ a numerical model to estimate the extent of the contamination in groundwater, and to submit a response action outcome statement. respondent has not retracted the ros submittal or addressed other violations including the lack of a health and safety plan, immediate response action completion statement, substantial hazard evaluation, and possible ongoing source area associated with contaminated soil in the

assve remedial system was deactivated in 2002 after the remedial objectives for this the remedy were achieved. originally, remedial wastewater from the bedrock groundwater pump and treatment system was discharged to surface water under a national pollutant discharge elimination system (npdes) exclusion permit issued by the environmental protection agency (epa). b, in january 2006, the epa issued the site remediation general permit (rgp) mag910186. however, the treatment system encountered difficulties meeting the new rgp discharge requirements for iron.. in october 2007, massdep received a phase iv remedy implementation plan (rip) modification which documented the redirection of treatment system discharge into the onsite former sve piping network. although the sve piping network was not originally designed as a groundwater infiltration gallery, limited pilot testing described in the october 2007 rip modification concluded that the sve piping network met the design criteria for repurposed use as a groundwater infiltration gallery. subsequent focused monitoring near the infiltration gallery (described in the august 8, 2009 ros status report) confirmed that the sve piping network was adequate for use as a groundwater infiltration gallery. however, between 2009 and november 2013, the infiltration gallery (i.e., he former sve piping) fouled with iron, causing frequent backpressure fault shutdowns of the remediation system and repetitive surficial breakouts of remedial wastewater, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0893(2)(c) and 310 cmr 40.0045(1)(a). c. the ros report, received by the department on january 31, 2014, documented that the bedrock groundwater pump and treatment was deactivated on november 14, 2013, due to continued breakout of treated water at the reinjection locations. this notification of system deactivation was not provided within thirty (30) days, as required by 310 cmr 40.0893(6), but was received seventynine (79) days after system deactivation. additionally, the report indicated that respondent was evaluating alternatives for discharging treated water, but did not provide a plan or timetable for returning the system to operational status within one hundred twenty (120) days, nor was the ros terminated, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0893(6). d. on june 12, 2014, massdep received a release abatement measure (ram) plan filed by respondent. the ram plan proposed the installation of a new groundwater injection gallery to receive discharge from the bedrock groundwater pump and treatment system.in the matter of peterborough oil co. llc acopce153a001nt page 3 e. on july 22, 2014, massdep conducted an audit inspection which confirmed that the bedrock pump and treatment system was not operational. during the audit inspection, massdep verbally notified the licensed site professional of the violations described above. f. on august 8, 2014, the respondent submitted a ros termination, temporary solution, and tier classification extension request for public comment under the public involvement plan (pip) requirements for the site. g. after the completion of the pip comment period, the respondent terminated ros, and filed with massdep both a tier classification extension request, and a temporary solution for the site on september 9, 2014. h. on september 12, 2014, massdep verbally requested that the bedrock groundwater pump and treatment system not be reactivated by respondent until after massdep has received a revised phase iv operation, maintenance, and monitoring (omm) plan for discharge into the recently installed onsite groundwater infiltration gallery. i. on october 10, 2014, the respondent prepared a phase iv modification that included a revised omm plan for public comment under the pip requirements for the site. after the completion of the pip public comment period the respondent submitted the phase iv modification with the revised omm plan to massdep on november 6, 2014. on may

contained in the remedy operation status (ros) submittal received on july 25, 2001, and subsequent ros submittals received through october 25, 2004, indicate that separatephase cutting oil exists on groundwater beneath the northern portion of the former new york twist drill building. i manual recovery of cutting oil is conducted monthly from twelve wells located within the northern portion of the building.. a notice of activity and use limitation (aul), recorded for the site to maintain a condition of no substantial hazard, identifies measures (e.g., permanent engineered vapor barrier placement) to eliminate potential exposure to petroleum vapor migration to indoor air. sampling of indoor air or soil gas was not performed for the phase i risk characterization, or to determine if a substantial hazard was present prior to or after recording the aul, or following refurbishment of the onsite building which included installation of a vapor barrier. the company has noted that since the entire building was gutted ahd renovated by current owners, compounds emitted by new building materials made such air tests impracticable. vapor barrier emplacement, considered a response action to contain or control potential contaminant migration, was not performed by the current owners under the oversight of the licensed site professional (lsp)ofrecord, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0810(5).

a. the site was identified in 1997 due to the detection of 1,4dichlorobenzene (1,4dcb) in the public drinking water supply well serving the property at concentrations exceeding the applicable reporting concentrations (rcgw1). release tracking number (rtn) 20012059 was assigned to the site. assessment at the site identified a former drywell as the source of 1,4dcb and other chlorinated solvents in groundwater. as part of an immediate response action (ira), several residential drinking water wells proximate to the site were sampled for volatile organic compound (voc) analysis in february 1998. samples collected from private wells located at 421 and 434 west main street contained detectable concentrations of chlorinated vocs that were below rcgw1. b. in january 1999, a drinking water sample was collected from the 434. west main street residential well. analytical results indicated that the concentration of 1,4dcb exceeded rcgw1. was assigned to this release condition. in response to this data, respondent conducted a second ira consisting of installation of a carbon adsorption treatment system for the 434 west main street drinking water well. an ira completion report was submitted to massdep on march 29, 1999, for . c. an jra completion report for was submitted to massdep on july 21, 1999. the ira completion report concluded (1) the apparent source of groundwater contamination was the former drywell at respondents facility, (2) site conditions appeared to be stabilized and (3) an imminent hazard did not exist. at the time of the ira completion report for , one round of sampling had been completed at the 421 west main street potable well, and one round of groundwater sampling was completed in bedrock monitoring wells gz1 and gz2. this limited data set was not sufficient to establish groundwater contaminant trends influenced by seasonal variations (precipitation events, droughts) and varying seasonal well pumping rates. therefore, the conclusion that site conditions were stable was not supported as required to complete ira actions in accordance with 310 cmr 40.0427. also, the limited data set collected at 421 w. main street was insufficient to determine the degree of hazard to human health from exposure to site contaminants as required by 310 cmr 40.0414(a). further ira actions (assessment andor mitigation) were required to verify or ensure that concentrations of contaminants detected in drinking water at 421 west main street were stable and consistently below rcgw1. failure to perform an ira in accordance with mcp provisions is a violation of 310 cmr 40.0420(2). d. in february 2002, four years after the detection of site contaminants in the residential well, a second drinking water sample was collected from the 421 west main street. residence. chlorobenzene, cis1,2dichlorethene and 1,2dichlorobenzene were detected at concentrations less than rcgw1. two years later, in march 2004 another sample was collected from 421 west main street, which also contained low levels of the same three contaminants. in march 2004, respondent installed carbon filtration units on thesees evtnadis neon

drinking water supply wells at the site and at two residences in the vicinity of the site. a review of an aerial photograph of i the area, and observations made during the site inspection, revealed that at least two additional residences (433 and 438 west main street) are proximate to, and hydraulically i downgradient of 434 west main street, where the drinking water supply well has been contaminated by the release at the site. drinking water wells from these residences were not sampled to determine whether they were also contaminated. contamination in these wells would require notification to massdep and the performance of an ira. by failing to sample these private wells, respondent failed to continually assess for conditions requiring an ira, in a violation of 310 cmr

contiguous volume of contaminated soil comprised of one or more categories as defined in 310 cmr 40.0933, a separate and distinct exposure point shall be represented by the soil in each category. facts on november 7, 2001, the department received a response action outcome statement and supporting method 2 risk characterization. the risk characterization identified petroleum contamination at depths ranging from 3 feet to 10 feet below grade level. the site was historically operated as a storage facility for petroleum using aboveground storage tanks (asts). ground surface beneath the asts was unpaved. surficial soil samples were not collected and analyzed for potential contaminants of concern. the risk characterization did not identify surficial soil in the former ast area as an exposure point. three surficial soil samples were collected by a department auditor on october 18, 2002, from an unpaved portion of the site, identified as the location of former asts. analysis of the samples revealed concentration of extractable petroleum hydrocarbons (eph) exceeding applicable s2 method 2 direct contact standards.c.k. smith co., inc. acopce033007 rin 200266 page 4 of 13 violation surficial soil was not sampled despite boring log information indicating that subsurface soil was impacted by petroleum in these areas. surficial soil contamination from petroleum fuel oil was confirmed through the audit of the response action outcome (rao) statement. analytical results of soil samples collected. revealed extractable petroleum hydrocarbon levels in a sample collected near the former aboveground storage tank area in excess of applicable s2 method 2 direct contact standards. another surficial soil sample collected near monitoring well cea8 contained elevated concentrations of extractable petroleum hydrocarbons. soil categories s1 applies for unrestricted future uses of the site, and s2 and s3 apply for current uses. the method 2 risk characterization did not identify surficial soil as an exposure point for current andor foreseeable site activities and uses in violation of 310 cmr 40,0924. since a direct contact exposure point exceeded method 2 standards, a condition of no significant risk has not been supported. 3. failure to meet response action performance standard (raps) a. law 310 cmr 40.0191 response action performance standards (1) the response action performance standard (raps) is the level of diligence reasonably necessary to obtain the quantity and quality of information adequate to assess a site and evaluate remedial action alternatives, and to design and implement specific remedial actions at a disposal site to achieve a level of no significant risk for any foreseeable period of time and, where feasible, to reduce to the extent possible the level of oil andor hazardous materials in the environment to background levels. facts the site historically contained asts for fuel oil storage. surface cover in the ast area is unpaved. subsurface investigation in the ast area identified fuel oil contamination at 3 feet to 10 feet below grade. surficial soil was not sampled in the ast area. the rao did not provide technical justification for not sampling surficial soil. surficial soil was observed by the department to be petroleum stained and to contain a petroleum odor. sampling of surficial soil by the department confirmed petroleum concentrations above applicable risk characterization standards.c.k. smith co., inc. acopce033007 cc. rtn 200266 page 5 of 13 violation failure to sample visibly contaminated surficial soil in a potential source area does not demonstrate a level of diligence necessary to obtain the quantity and quality of information adequate to assess and evaluate remedial action alternatives and demonstrate a level of no significant risk. therefore, the response action performance standard (raps) was not met in violation of 310 cmr 40.0191. 4, failure to properly implement an activity and use limitation a. law 310 cmr 40.1070 implementation of activity and use limitations (2) activity and use limitations imposed pursuant to 310 cmr. 40.1012 shall be

conducting response actions at the disposal site or portion of a disposal site in accordance with the procedures established in 310 cmr 40.1070 through 310 cmr 40.1099. facts on february 6, 2001, ck smith executed and implemented a notice of activity and use limitation (aul) for the site. the aul area includes the entire site property as described in exhibit a of the aul and depicted on a plan attached as exhibit b to the aul. permitted activities stipulated in the aul include (i) activities and uses including, but not limited to, vehicular parking, pedestrian and vehicular traffic, which do not compromise the structural integrity of the pavement andor disturb petroleumimpacted soil located beneath the pavement (ii) commercial, retail and industrial activities and uses which do not

immediately following completion of the project. the aul opinion, attached as exhibit c to the aul, states as illustrated by exhibit b attached hereto, the entire site will be included in the aul. a onestory automotive service garage occupies the center of the property the remainder of the site is paved. violation permitted activities stipulated in the aul allow those that do not reduce pavement integrity and those that do not disturb petroleumimpacted soils. the aul encompasses the entire parcel subject to the rao. the departments audit revealed that substantial portions of the site are not paved, or contain damaged, broken pavement, and allow direct contact with petroleumimpacted soils at the surface. this condition is inconsistent with the aul, therefore, the aul was not properly implemented in violation of 310 cmr 40.1070(2). 5. failure to meet requirements of a notice of activity and use limitation law 310 cmr 40.1074 notice of activity and use limitation (1) general

submittals. according to the rao, the respondent allows motor vehicle repair and maintenance activities at the site. in the rao, respondent identified the presence of an active catch basindrywell located inside the vehicle maintenance bays at the facility. the catch basindrywell consisted of concrete block construction, with a paver stone bottom, which was installed circa 1975 when the building was erected. respondent concluded that the catch basin was selfleaching and is not connected to an oilwater separator or tight tank to prevent the waste oil and motor vehicle runoff from discharging into the environment. respondent did not propose or complete any required connections to rectify this situation, despite the ongoing discharge from this structure. the site inspection by massdep on february 28, 2014, confirmed the continued maintenance, operation, and leaching of the catch basindrywell, which constitutes the impermissible operation of a motor vehicle waste disposal well, in violation of 310 cmr 27.04(5). c. respondents failure to cease the direct discharge to the catch basindrywell is also a violation of 310 cmr 40.1003(a)5, which states that an rao cannot be

(santander). the third property is 402 grove street, owned by altab and the location of a single story restaurant building. the santander driveway bifurcates the 400 grove street and 402 grove street parcels. groundwater is believed to generally flow in a northwest to southeast direction. b. the site was first identified as a location to be investigated in 1989 due to historic petroleum contamination associated with former service station operations at the 400 grove street property and was assigned . chlorinated hydrocarbons were subsequently identified in soil and groundwater on all three parcels. c. in february 2007, an imminent hazard was identified due to elevated concentrations of tetrachloroethylene in indoor air at the 400 grove street building and was mitigated by the installation of a subslab venting system and periodic indoor air quality sampling to ensure effectiveness of exposure pathway control. this release was assigned . d. on april 14, 2010, a temporary solution intended to achieve a permanent solution was submitted for the 400 grove street and 402 grove street portions of the site. the plan to achieve a permanent solution for the 400 grove and 402 grove street parcels relied upon implementation of a proposed chemical oxidation remediation system conducted by santander despite santanders stated intentions in its own separate remedial plan to limit remedial application principally to the driveway portion of the site owned by santander. e. on july 14, 2010, santander submitted a partial permanent solution for the driveway portion of the site, indicating that there would be no further operation of the remediation system by the bank. by relying on a system operated by a third party that was limited in scope both geographically and

portion of the site to compliance by conducting assessment and reevaluation of the remedial approach first proposed in the april 2010 temporary solution, including a resumption of indoor air testing at both properties. h. respondents failed to continue the remediation system, failed to demonstrate feasible control of groundwater and vaporphase plumes of ohm and otherwise failed to demonstrate a

onsite.drinking water supply well and within 500 feet of approximately a dozen other residential drinking water supply wells. the laboratory report that provided this information to the company was dated november 24, 2004. based on the concentrations of bph detected, the licensed site professional (lsp) for the company determined that no imminent hazard as defined in the massachusetts contingency plan, 310 cmr 40.0000, existed at the site. the conipany did not provide notification within 72hours of its knowledge of this condition, believing that this condition was consistent and expected as a direct result of the light nonaqueous phase liquid (lnapl) in the subsurface environment. during the inspection on july 27, 2005, and in subsequent oral communications, the lsp was advised of massdeps opinion that the contamination detected constituted a 72hour notification condition. the lsp was also informed during the july 27, 2005 inspection that massdep would provide, in writing, the details of any alleged violations in a notice of audit findingsnotice of enforcement conference. the notice of enforcement conference, dated october 18, 2005, was received by the lsp on november 3, 2005. the company provided. notification of petroleum concentrations exceeding rcgw1 within 500 feet of private drinking water wells on september 13, 2005, eitingboth the historic dep

acopce063a002 release tracking no. 20012656 e. massdep alleges that the notification condition identified in november 2004 required an immediate response action (ira). during the inspection on july 27, 2005, and in subsequent communications, the lsp was advised of the need to conduct the ira. on september 13, 2005, the company proposed and massdep approved an ira including sampling of all private wells within 500 feet of the site. massdep alleges that by failing to provide notification in november 2004, the company failed to conduct the required ira in a timely manner, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0412(2). bf, the numerical ranking system (nrs) scoresheet states that there are no fish habitats within 500 feet of the site. however, figure i in phase i, and observations during inspection, show that partridgeville pond. is approximately 300 feet from the downgradient property border, and approximately 450 feet from the release area. in addition, massdep alleged that the nrs submitted on july 15, 2005 did not score appropriately for the likely indoor air contamination identified in the phase i report however, the lsp, in subsequent correspondence dated december 2, 2005, provided the appropriate documentation to support the scoring presented in the original nrs submittal. therefore, numerical ranking system (nrs) scoresheet submitted with the tier classification. submittal on july 15, 2005, did not accurately score the site, in violation of 310 cmr 40.1500, based solely upon the miscalculated distance of the disposal site from partridgeville pond. .the nrs has been corrected and the changes did not result in a change in tier classification g. the parties have agreed to enter into this consent order without admitting any of the allegations contained herein, because they agree that it is in their own interests, and in the public interest, to proceed promptly to resolve this enforcement action rather than to expend additional time and resources litigating

2012, massdep personnel observed a skidsteer loader (i.e. bobcat) and evidence of recent soil movement at the site. the sites tenant, patrick sullivan (site tenant) of worcester photo studios, llc, confirmed that he was moving soil to regrade the site. stockpiled soil was observed at the site. the site tenant stated that he was aware of residual fuel oil contamination at the site, and that he had permission from respondent to conduct the work. when massdep personnel inquired of respondent regarding the site tenants activities, respondent stated that he was unaware of and had not provided permission for the site tenant to conduct excavation and grading of soil. the aul identifies obligations and conditions set forth in the aul opinion to include a requirement that excavation of

to permitted and inconsistent site activities and uses, and obligations and conditions to limit exposure to soil contamination, but does not clearly state for purposes of risk communication where soil contamination is located on the site (e.g. at depths of three feet below grade or more), thereby indicating that all soil within the aul area must be considered contaminated unless shown otherwise, as

location on site and notes the sample with the highest reported levels of tph and perc (s11) was collected from a limited area of soils situated beneath a large tree that was being undermined, and therefore, those soils were left in place. concentrations of tph (i.e. total petroleum hydrocarbons) and perc (i.e. tetrachloroethylene) in soil sample s11 were detected at 9,500 mgkg and 260 mgkg,

however, further sampling was not conducted beyond the excavation to determine the extent of soil contamination remaining at the site, as required by 310 cmr 40.0904(2)(a). soil in the vicinity of s11

during the may 17, 2012 inspection, massdep required that respondent andor site tenant obtain an lsp opinion to characterize stockpiled soils, in accordance with aul obligations and conditions that soils excavated from the area identified as the location of contaminated soil should be tested and, if warranted, treated pursuant to the appropriate state and federal waste disposal regulations, and to develop a health and safety plan to continue soil grading work. the respondent was also informed that all soils must be stockpiled on and covered with plastic sheeting, and that any stockpiled soils must be enclosed with a snow fence to restrict access by neighborhood children. . on june 4, 2012, massdep issued separate requests for information (rfis) to respondent and the site tenant. the rfi responses revealed conflicting accounts of the site tenants knowledge of the aul requirements. respondent stated that the site tenant was provided a copy of the aul and made aware of the aul by inclusion in the lease for the site. the site tenant stated that he had no knowledge of the aul. on july 11, 2012, respondent provided a copy of the lease to massdep. the lease does not reference the aul, in violation of 310 cmr 40.1074(5). in addition, the lease fails to state that the site tenant must implement and adhere to the auls requirements, which is also a violation of 310 cmr 40.1070(2)

concentrations are indicative of likely indoor air impacts requiring direct indoor air sampling to confirm aph concentrations within the building basement. on april 19, 2010, two addition soil gas samples, sg3 and sg4, were taken from two locations several feet away from the excavation to the south, the results indicated aph of up to 41,000 pgm3 c5c8 aliphatics. these soil gas samples were then averaged with ail gas concentrations from sg1 and sg2 resulting i in an average concentration below the screening levels to conduct direct indoor air sampling, due to the dynamic nature of vapor migration, which may be subject to seasonal variation and intrusion via preferential migration pathways such as cracks and floor seams, averaging of soil gas samples may underestimate . the potential for vapor infiltration, into indoor air. indoor air sampling was not performed to determine the extent of contamination in indoor air, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0904(2)(a). by failing to sample

laboratory analysis once on february 17, 2010 approximately nine months after discovery of the release. all ground water sampling results were below detection limits, this confirmed that ground water to the northeast toward the river was not impacted at that time. the close proximity of the charles river, however, establishes the potential for groundwater flow to fluctuate significantly and reverse directions at certain times during the year when the river changes from a gaining state to a losing state (and vice versa), the flow of ground water onsite may also be influenced by a curve in the charles river and the foundation of a former bridge near the release area, the release occurred in may 2009, and soil removal was not conducted until november 2009, the delay in soil removal and fluctuations of groundwater and surface water influence may have resulted in groundwater contamination migration to the north or west, in accordance with 310 cmr 40.0924(2)(b)2., the drinking water well is considered a potential exposure point for which an exposure point concentration must be determined to meet applicable standards to demonstrate a condition of no significant risk. therefore, a

obtain approval for a significant modification to an immediate response action (ira). on february 7, 1996, an ira plan was received by the department that specified collection of fuel oil nonaqueous phase liquid (napl) using a pneumatic skimmer. the napl recovery system was orally approved by the department on march 18, 1996. the napl recovery system was activated on april 1, 1996. thecatholic charities, 210720211029 2 administrative consent order wpenalty 15 ripley st., worcester acopce053a014 ira completion statement received by the department on june 20, 2001, indicated that operation of the recovery system was shut down some time in mid1999. no exact date was provided. technical justification for deactivation prior to implementation of comprehensive response actions was not provided in the ira completion statement. deactivation of the napl recovery system constitutes a significant modification to the ira. an ira plan modification was not submitted to the department prior to deactivating the approved skimmer pump. deactivation of the recovery system was not approved by the department, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0420(6). b. failure to stabilize site conditions prior to submitting an immediate response action completion statement. the pneumatic bailing system that was approved as an ira to reduce the level of napl in monitoring wells at the site was discontinued in mid1999, thicknesses of napl found to be present within monitoring well cee1 had ranged from 3.34 feet in october 1997 to 23.99 feet in march 1998. napl thickness since deactivation in 1999 has ranged from 5.35 feet in june 2001 to 18.85 feet in may 2003. passive bailing, conducted as a comprehensive response action, was not initiated until february 2001. an ira completion statement was received by the department on june 20, 2001. levels of napl increased after the recovery system was shut down and passive bailing was initiated as a comprehensive response action. therefore, the ira completion statement was submitted before the site conditions giving rise to the ira were stabilized, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0427(1)(a). c, failure to reclassify a disposal site, the site was classified as tier ii in 1996 with a numerical ranking system (nrs) score of 263. borings advanced and monitoring wells installed in 1998 revealed the presence of napl six inches below the boiler roommaintenance office. air monitoring results from samples collected in october 1999 within the onsite residential building contained petroleum hydrocarbons above background concentrations. detected indoor air concentrations above background levels are considered a likely or confirmed exposure pathway, which would change the numerical ranking system score to 363, exceeding the tier ic threshold score of 350. additionally, oil or hazardous materials (ohm) toxicity scores were incorrectly based on dissolved concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons in groundwater rather than napl. a revised nrs scoresheet and a tier i permit application was not submitted to the department, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0530(1).. .catholic charities, 210720211029 3 administrative consent order wpenalty 15 ripley st., worcester acopce053a014 d. failure to meet phase iit performance standards. a phase ii remedial action plan (rap) was received by the department on february 17, 2000. the phase iii considers three remedial alternatives as technically feasible (1) soil excavation for source removal of subsurface petroleum (2) high vacuum extraction (hve) of liquid phase petroleum and (3) collection of oil with passive diffusion bailers. boring logs indicate that as many as 75 blows were required to advance a split spoon soil collector six inches. test pit logs uniformly indicate that soils consisted of fine grain sand and clay and are described as dense, which is typically considered less conducive to passive recovery than hve or soil excavation. passive recovery was selected based upon the relative cost in comparison with hve and soil excavation. the phase iii rap states, alternative 1 (passive recovery) would attain a temporary solution relatively rapidly (i.e. within six months). on the other hand, product recovery would likely be ongoing for decades. the other two alternatives were reported to take from six months to three years to achieve a permanent solution. in addition, the report acknowledges that passive recovery posed higher future exposure risk. the phase iii rap estimated approximately 2,500 gallons of fuel oil product to be located within a limited area of approximately 11,250 square feet. the phase iii cost estimate table estimates that approximately 400 gallons of product could be removed from the subsurface annually with passive recovery. between august 2002 and june 2003, the passive bailers recovered 3.53 gallons. approximately 540 gallons of oil and water were collected via the pneumatic skimmer pump utilized during ira activities from april 1996 to 1999. the phase iii rap failed to select an effective remedial alternative that is reasonably likely to achieve a level of no significant risk in a timely manner taking into consideration site characteristics in comparison to other feasible technologies, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0853. e, failure to meet class c response action outcome requirements. the class c response action outcome (rao) statement described only operation of the passive recovery system (temporary solution) in the portion devoted to achieving a permanent solution. at the passive napl recovery rate of less than 5 gallonsyear, it would take more than 500 years to remove the estimated volume of oil product in the subsurface environment. a section of the rao is entitled steps toward a permanent solution. however, no definitive and enterprising steps were described, such as contingencies if remedial goals (e.g. product recovery estimates) were not met, in violation of 310 cmr 40,01050(5)(a).catholic charities,

to evaluate the feasibility of manual bailing and vacuum extraction. the pilot tests demonstrated manual bailing to be effective to reduce and maintain napl thicknesses. on november 10, 2004, the department received a periodic evaluation of the temporary solution recommending continued manual bailing at a frequency of an approximately threeweek basis to allow a recoverable amount of napl to accumulate at thicknesses of approximately 1.5 fi. in monitoring wells cee1 and cee2 and 0.25 ft. in monitoring well gzas. 5. the parties have agreed to enter into this consent order because they

1997, respondent purchased the site from charles t. skowron by virtue of a warranty deed, recorded with the worcester county registry of deeds at book 19406, page 198. the aul is not referenced in the warranty deed. c. on june 21, 2012, massdep personnel conducted an audit inspection at the site. during this inspection, massdep observed what appeared to be evidence of a recent excavation in the area of the southeastern corner of the building. in addition, there appeared to be a recently excavated trench leading to a padmounted transformer. d. just prior to the inspection, massdep spoke with marc dipietro, trustee for respondent ( trustee), by telephone on june 18, 2012. at that time, trustee stated that he was aware of the aul at the site. trustee stated that a new transformer was recently installed at the site, and he thought that massdep was notified of the work being conducted by national grid. trustee provided massdep with contact information for national grid, and asserted that the work was not conducted in the hot zone. e. on august 20, 1012, massdep issued separate requests for information (rfis) to respondent and national grid. the rfi response from national grid states that while the company did install a new transformer at the site, it did not conduct any excavation at the site. f. the response to the rfi submitted by respondent indicates that site tenant robert chalue (site tenant) had requested that the new transformer be installed by national grid. respondent approved the installation as site owner. g. the aul identifies activities and uses inconsistent with the aul opinion to include any excavations and other earth work without proper training for work at hazardous waste sites per osha 29 cfr 1910.020. h. trench excavation was performed on site property subject to the aul by ryan eldredge of eldredge building and remodeling during the spring of 2012. according to massdeps telephone conversation with mr. eldredge, he has not been trained for work at hazardous waste sites, as required by the aul, in violation of 310 cmr 40.1070(2). i. the aul notes requirements relative to permitted and inconsistent site activities and uses, and obligations and conditions to limit exposure to soil contamination. review of the accompanying aul opinion (exhibit c) of the aul, confirms respondents assertion that the contaminated portion of the site (i.e. the hot zone) is not located in the area of the transformer installation and trench excavation. however, the activities and uses inconsistent with the aul do not clearly state for purposes ofin the matter of 7381 ashland avenue realty trust acopce133a003 page 3 of 10 tisk communication that osha requirements are limited to areas of the site where residual soil contamination is

obtain approval for a significant modification to an immediate response action (tra). on february 7, 1996, an ira plan was received by the department that specified collection of fuel oil nonaqueous phase liquid (napl) using a pneumatic skimmer. the napl recovery system was orally approved by the department on march 18, 1996. the napl recovery system was activated on april 1, 1996. thecatholic

the recovery system was shut down some time in mid1999, no exact date was provided. technical justification for deactivation prior to implementation of comprehensive response actions was not provided in the ira completion statement. deactivation of the napl recovery system constitutes a significant modification to the ira. an ira plan modification was not submitted to the department prior to deactivating the approved skimmer pump. deactivation of the recovery system was not approved by the department, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0420(6). b. failure to stabilize site conditions prior to submitting an immediate response action completion statement. the pneumatic bailing system that was approved as an ira to reduce the level of napl in monitoring wells at the site was discontinued in mid1999. thicknesses of napl found to be present within monitoring well cee1 had ranged from 3.34 feet in october 1997 to 23.99 feet in march 1998. napl thickness since deactivation in 1999 has ranged from 5.35 feet in june 2001 to 18.85 feet in may 2003. passive bailing, conducted as a comprehensive response action, was not initiated until february 2001. an ira completion statement was received by the department on june 20, 2001. levels of napl increased after the recovery system was shut down and passive bailing was initiated as a comprehensive response action. therefore, the ira completion statement was submitted before the site conditions giving rise to the ira were stabilized, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0427(1)(a). c. failure to reclassify a disposal site. the site was classified as tier h in 1996 with a numerical ranking system (nrs) score of 263. borings advanced and monitoring wells installed in 1998 revealed the presence of napl six inches below the boiler roommaintenance office. air monitoring results from samples collected in october 1999 within the onsite residential building contained petroleum hydrocarbons above background concentrations. detected indoor air concentrations above background levels are considered a likely or confirmed exposure pathway, which would change the numerical ranking system score to 363, exceeding the tier ic threshold score of 350. additionally, oil or hazardous materials (ohm) toxicity scores were incorrectly based on dissolved concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons in groundwater rather than napl. a revised nrs scoresheet and a tier i permit application was not submitted to the department, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0530(1).catholic charities, 210720211029 3 administrative consent order wpenalty 15 ripley st., worcester acopce053a014 d. failure to meet phase iii performance standards. a phase iit remedial action plan (rap) was received by the department on february 17, 2000. the phase hi considers three remedial alternatives as technically feasible (1) soil excavation for source removal of subsurface petroleum (2) high vacuum extraction (hve) of liquid phase petroleum and (3) collection of oil with passive diffusion bailers. boring logs indicate that as many as 75 blows were required to advance a split spoon soil collector six inches. test pit logs uniformly indicate that soils consisted of fine grain sand and clay and are described as dense, which is typically considered less conducive to passive recovery than hve or soil excavation. passive recovery was selected based upon the relative cost in comparison with hve and soil excavation. the phase iii rap states, alternative 1 (passive recovery) would attain a temporary solution relatively rapidly (ic. within six months). on the other hand, product recovery would likely be ongoing for decades. the other two alternatives were reported to take from six months to three years to achieve a permanent solution. in addition, the report acknowledges that passive recovery posed higher future exposure risk. the phase iii rap estimated approximately 2,500 gallons of fuel oil product to be located within a limited area of approximately 11,250 square feet. the phase iii cost estimate table estimates that approximately 400 gallons of product could be removed from the subsurface annually with passive recovery. between august 2002 and june 2003, the passive bailers recovered 3.53 gallons. approximately 540 gallons of oil and water were collected via the pneumatic skimmer pump utilized during ira activities from april 1996 to 1999. the phase iii rap failed to select an effective remedial alternative that is reasonably likely to achieve a level of no significant risk in a timely manner taking into consideration site characteristics in comparison to other feasible technologies, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0853. e. failure to meet class c response action outcome requirements. the class c response action outcome (rao) statement described only operation of the passive recovery system (temporary solution) in the portion devoted to achieving a permanent solution. at the passive napl recovery rate of less than 5 gallonsyear, it would take more than 500 years to remove the estimated volume of oil product in the subsurface environment. a section of the rao is entitled steps toward a permanent solution. however, no definitive and enterprising steps were described, such as contingencies if remedial goals (e.g. product recovery estimates) were not met, in violation of 310 cmr 40.01050(5)(a).catholic charities,

conducted to evaluate the feasibility of manual bailing and vacuum extraction. the pilot tests demonstrated manual bailing to be effective to reduce and maintain napl thicknesses. on november 10, 2004, the department received a periodic evaluation of the temporary solution recommending continued manual bailing at a frequency of an approximately threeweek basis to allow a recoverable amount of napl to accumulate at thicknesses of approximately 1.5 ft. in monitoring wells cee1 and cee2 and 0.25 ft. in monitoring well gza5. 5. the parties have agreed to enter into this consent order because

(gec) advanced soil borings at the site and identified metals (antimony, cadmium, chromium, lead and nickel) in soil at levels that exceeded the rcs1 reportable concentrations of the mcp. gec detected total chromium at a concentration of 500 mgkg in one sample (b13) collected from a depth of 03 feet. below the ground surface. this condition met the criteria for a release that could pose a potential imminent hazard (th), 310 cmr 40.0321(2)(b) provides, in part, that a release to the environment indicated by the measurement of concentrations of hexavalent chromium (or total chromium in the absence

imminent hazard to human health unless access by children is controlled or prevented by means of bituminous pavement, concrete, fence, or other physical barrier. . respondent obtained knowledge of the potential ih release condition on or about july 7, 2011, when gec transmitted to respondent an electronic copy of the analytical summary tables and a site sketch showing the sample locations. respondent was required to notify massdep of the potential ih condition within two hours of knowledge, but failed to do so. respondents failure to notify massdep constitutes a violation of 310 cmr

inc., on behalf of respondent, conducted further assessment to confirm gecs findings. soil samples from 13 borings advanced at the site and abutting property showed similar metals and concentrations within the top five feet of fill, which was consistent with gecs findings. however, no samples were collected from the area where the elevated chromium level had been reported previously by gec. while respondent was required to evaluate the site conditions to determine whether a potential ih or other immediate response action (ira) condition was present at the site, respondent failed to do so. this failure violated 310 cmr 40,041 1(7), which provides, in part, that prps shall continually assess and evaluate release and site conditions in order to determine if an ira is required. . on november 11, 2011, respondent submitted a release notification form (rnf) to massdep for a 120day release notification condition. the rnf identified antimony, cadmium, chromium, lead and nickel in soil above the applicable rcs1 reportable concentrations. massdep assigned rtn 218412 to this release. on november 14, 2012, massdep received a tier if classification submittal prepared by geolnsight, inc. the

october 2011. the submittal characterized the site as a vacant, unpaved lot. on november 1419, 2012, respondent regraded and paved the disposal site. the paving was designed by geolnsight as an engineered barrier to eliminate the soil exposure pathway and thereby achieve a response action outcome (rao), the work included the removal and relocation of surficial topsoil from the north portion of the site to the southwest corner and along the northern border installation of a new drainage line and catch basin incorporating the excess fill from the catch basin into the new subgrade installation of 812 inches of structural gravel base course installation of two inches of asphalt binder pavement and installation of 2436 inches of final cover in unpaved areas. reportedly, no contaminated soil was removed from the site during the work, the excavation and onsite reuse of contaminated soil, and the construction of an engineered barrier were mcp response actions that required the submittal of a release abatement measure (ram) plan. respondents failure to submit a ram plan prior to the initiation of this work was in violation of 310 cmr 40,0443(1), which provides, in part, that a ram shall not be conducted at any disposal site until a complete release abatement measure plan, as described in 310 cmr 40.0444, has been received by massdep. respondent did not provide the

consent order a. on june 30, 1998, respondent notified massdep of gasoline constituents in groundwater at concentrations that exceeded applicable reportable concentrations (rcgw1) within 500 feet of drinking water supply wells. this condition was assigned ,. respondent was required to notify massdep immediately and no later than 72hours from obtaining knowledge of thisfile no. acopce063a022 zz condition. a review of historical groundwater data reveals that contaminants exceeded rcgw1 in samples collected in april 1997, september 1997 and february 1998. therefore, the 72hour reporting condition was first reported to massdep more than a year after respondent obtained the initial data exceeding rcgw1, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0313(3). b. in october 1998, respondent sampled private water supply wells within 500 feet of the site as an immediate response action (ira). on january 14, 1999, respondent submitted an ira completion statement (irac) that stated on the basis of the lack of detection of gasoline constituents in either the onsite or offsite water supply wells atid given the age of the gasoline release, we conclude that the site (sic)does not pose a short term risk to area water supplies. therefore, in our opinion, additional immediate response actions are not warranted. the irac included the labotatory analytical reports for drinking water sampled in october 1998. the analytical reports document the detection of methyl tertiarybutylether (mtbe) in two ofthe private water supply wells located between 550 feet and 725 feet west of the property at 195 city depot road, contradicting the conclusory statement in the irac. therefore, respondent provided false, inaccurate, and misleading statements to massdep, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0022(2). c, on june 24, 2004, the charlton board of health informed massdep that mtbe had been detected in a newly installed private drinking water supply well at 164 city depot road, located approximately 1,600 feet southwest of the site. massdep contacted respondent and requested that they resample this private well. on august 9, 2004, after respondent resampled the well and confirmed the presence of mibe, massdep requested that respondent provide notification within 72 hours for a condition of substantial release migration (srm) as defined at 310 cmr 40.0006. respondent did not notify massdep until august 18, 2004, nine days after confirming the detection of mibe within a private drinking water well. therefore, respondent failed to notify massdep within 72 hours of obtaining knowledge of the condition of srm, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0313(5). massdep assigned release tracking number (rin) 20015375 to the condition of srm in august 2004. d. from october 1998 through august 2004, respondent failed to conduct an ira in response to the srm, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0412(3). typical ira requirements would have included providing bottled water or treatment systems to affected residents and quarterly sampling of private water supply wells. e, the ira for the condition of srm required sampling of the seven private water supply wells that were within 500 feet of the site in september 2004. followingfile no. acopce063a022 3 detection of mtbe in some of the private wells, an additional 500foot radius was established from those locations where mibe was detected, and an additional seven private water supply wells were sampled in october and november 2004. in total, mtbe was detected in fifteen of the sixteen sampling locations at concentrations ranging from 0.8 ppb to 9.3 ppb. the presence of contamination in residential drinking water supply wells constitutes a critical exposure pathway (cep) as defined at 310 cmr 40.0006. respondent conducting an ira are required to eliminate or mitigate ceps where feasible. in this instance, the cep could have been mitigated through the provision of bottled water or point of entry treatment systems. respondent did not eliminate or mitigate the cep during the ira, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0414(4). respondent submitted an irac for on december 22, 2004, stating that mtbe contamination was ubiquitous in the bedrock and that the site was not the source of mtbe in private wells. however, a review of the file by massdep indicates that mibe was released at the site, and that the source area remediation was incomplete. in 1995 a gasoline underground storage tank, and the associated piping and pump island were removed. laboratory analyses of postexcavation soil samples collected in 1995 detected concentrations of mtbe up to 153 parts per million (ppm), exceeding the applicable method 1 risk characterization standard of 0.3 ppm mtbe for soil in drinking water areas. furthermore, because depth to the bedrock surface is approximately eight (8) feet below grade in the ust area, migration of mtbe into the bedrock aquifer would have been likely the conclusion of the 2004 irac for was not based upon assessment of the bedrock aquifer such as bedrock monitoring well installation, bedrock surface mapping, fracture analysis, borehole survey, or pump tests to evaluate hydrogeologic connectivity to the surficial aquifer, private wells, or surface water potentially impacted by road runoff, as detailed in massdep guidance document standard reference for monitoring wells, wsc31091. furthermore, sampling of private wells from similar hydrogeologic settings were not obtained to provide statistical analyses to demonstrate a ubiquitous condition of mtbe impacts in areas not potentially effected by a historic gasoline release. f. respondent submitted a phase ii comprehensive site assessment report (phase ii report) to massdep on march 28, 2001. concentrations of mtbe were first detected in private drinking water supply wells in october 1998, as previously described. this data was not incorporated into the phase ii report and assessment of the bedrock aquifer was not conducted to determine the extent of mtbe contamination. consequently, private wells were not evaluated as exposure points in the risk characterization included in the phase ii report. failure to define the horizontal and vertical extent of contamination is a violation of 310 cmr 40.0835(4)(f).file no. acopce063a022 4 g. respondent submitted a phase iv asbuilt construction report and final inspection report on may 31, 2002, stating that magnesium hydroxide was applied to the subsurface during comprehensive response actions. the potable water supply well at 195 city depot road is located approximately 70 feet from the treatment area. written approval from massdep was required prior to application of remedial additives within 100 feet of a private well. this written approval was not requested or obtained by respondent, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0046(3). h. as previously described, remedial additives were applied to the subsurface in october 2001. quarterly groundwater monitoring after application of remedial additives is required. initial post remediation groundwater monitoring was conducted on march 14, 2002, approximately five months after final application of remedial additives, in violation of 310 cmr 40.0046(4)(b). 5. the parties have agreed to enter into this consent order because they agree that it is in their own interests, and in the public interest, to
