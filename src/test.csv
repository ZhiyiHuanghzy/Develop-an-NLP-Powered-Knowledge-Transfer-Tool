john spirito lsp of gza geoenvironmental inc the rao report includes a method risk characterization asserting the conclusion a permanent solution and condition of no significant risk exists on the western portion of the site while a temporary solution exists on the eastern portion of the site the western portion of the site includes the valpey fisher corporation facility the former sand filter source area for the subject trichloroethylene tce release to groundwater and the adjacent wetland areas to the east the eastern portion of the site includes the areas to the east of the northbound lane of interstate between the highway and lumber street a program of monitored natural attenuation of site contaminants in groundwater on the eastern portion of the site is incorporated into the plan of definitive and enterprising steps of the class c rao a review of the supporting information does not support a permanent solution the conclusion of no significant risk and the class a rao for the western portion of the site according to information submitted to date there is significant evidence of the continued presence of dense nonaqueous phase liquid dnapl tce beneath the western portion of the site which constitutes a source of contamination within the meaning of cmr s and absent elimination or demonstrated control precludes a permanent solution at the site under cmr massdep bases this conclusion in part upon united states environmental protection agency epa guidance in evaluating whether there is a strong likelihood of dnapl at a disposal site in accordance with the response action performance standard under cmr and in accordance with the september epa final policy r evaluation of the likelihood of dnapl presence at npl sites the presence of a continuing source of dnapl in the saturated zone appears likely at the disposal site a review of the available data submitted in support of the rao and in prior and subsequent submittals indicates the tce release at the site resulted in maximum dissolved concentrations of approximately parts per million ppm or mgl signifying approximately of the solubility of tce in water and well within the epa guidance for confirmed dnapl presence at a disposal site following operation of the remedial system at the site between and in which over gallons of tce were reportedly recovered using a groundwater recovery and treatment system residual groundwater concentrations of tce in excess of solubility or ppm as evidenced by sample results from monitoring wells gza gza and gza reported during the timeframe continue to indicatehopkinton notice of audit findings and the likely presence of dnapl near the source area further the identification of concentrations in excess of ppm in samples from well gza located further south of the previously identified area of elevated tce groundwater concentrations and screened to a depth of feet below grade appears to indicate a mobile component toresidual dnapl at the site additionally and in accordance with epa guidance spatial patterns of dissolvedphase tce concentrations are characteristically higher at depth within the overburden aquifer as would be expected with saturated zone dnapl and as seen in the deeper screened overburden wells gza gza and gza a review of all the available information indicates the class c rao and monitored natural attenuation program for the eastern portion of the site are not appropriate given the likely presence of dnapl the existing monitoring well and limited data available firstly in accordance with cmr monitored attenuation is not appropriate in situations where there is presumed intermedia transfer likely to result in increasing concentrations in soil groundwater or other media the existence of likely residual and migrating dnapl at the site and the absence of any groundwater monitoring data from the existing monitoring well network on the western portion of the site since the time period leads to the conclusion of continued intermedia migration from separatephase tce to groundwater contrary to the requirement of a stable or shrinking groundwater plume following source dnapl elimination therefore the requirement to identify and control or eliminate the source to the extent feasible for the class c rao has not been demonstrated as required by cmr b secondly a review of the existing groundwater monitoring well network indicates there are no monitoring wells of sufficient depth south of gza to adequately define the southerly and easterly horizontal and vertical extent of likely dnapl at the site in violation of the requirement to determine the extent of contamination under cmr a further east and southeast of the general presumed dnapl area both deep overburden p and p and bedrock observation wells exist eg p however these wells have not been sampled for many years and not since the reconfirmed presence of likely dnapl downgradient of the source area and in the vicinity of well gza during the period according to newly obtained information new residential development southeast of the disposal site at and lumber street has included the installation of private potable supply wells no further information has been provided concerning the well depths aquifer pump rates sampling data or likelihood of impact from conditions emanating from the disposal site a review of the available site data indicates deep overburden wells p and p have historically exhibited low concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons associated with the disposal site wells p and ps are located furthest south and southeast from gza and closest to the aforementioned new residential supply wells as previously noted there are no bedrock observation wells south or southeast of gza and the currently known extent of likely dnapl at the site submittal of a class a rao without a sufficient demonstration of the elimination and control of sources of oil and hazardous materials without
